Motivation
Take the following code base:
// pagination.dto.ts
import { IsInt, IsOptional, IsPositive } from ""class-validator"";
import { Type } from ""class-transformer"";
export class PaginationOptionsDto {
  @IsInt()
  @IsPositive()
  @IsOptional()
  @Type(() => Number)
  readonly offset?: number;

  @IsInt()
  @IsPositive()
  @IsOptional()
  @Type(() => Number)
  readonly limit?: number;
}
// users.controller.ts
// ...
/**
 * A `GET` request against the `/users?name=James&offset=20&limit=10` endpoint
 * should return a paginated list of the users named James.
 */
@Get('users')
async getUsers(
  @Query(new ValidationPipe()) pagination?: PaginationOptionsDto,
  @Query('name') nameFilter?: string
) {
  console.log(pagination instanceof PaginationOptionsDto);
  console.log(pagination);
  return this.usersService.getUsers({name: nameFilter}, pagination);
}
// ...
Now if you take a look at the console output, you will see that:

pagination is not an instance of PaginationOptionsDto which can cause issues if you want to define some methods in this class.
pagination is an object (any) equal to {name: 'James', offset: 20, limit: 10}.

Weird, uh? I know that ""since it's a validation pipe it should only perform validation"", but still... weird.
Proposal
This PR adds the support of the following options to the ValidationPipe:

transform: The pipe will return an instance of the expected type.
strip: The pipe will return an instance of the expected type without the extra properties (ie: the name property on the example above). This option implicitly sets transform to true.
reject: The pipe will throw an error if it finds any unexpected property. This option implicitly sets transform and strip to true.

This is what it looks like:
@Get('/users')
async getUsers(
  @Query(new TransformationPipe({strip: true})) pagination?: PaginationOptionsDto,
  @Query('name') nameFilter?: string
) {
  console.log(pagination instanceof PaginationOptionsDto); // true
  console.log(pagination); // {limit: 10, offset: 20}
  return this.usersService.getUsers(pagination, {name: nameFilter});
}
This makes use of the class-validator latest release which provides the whitelisting feature.",7,19

Motivation
Take the following code base:
// sample.controller.ts
//...
  @Get(':id')
  async getById(
    @Param('id', new ParseIntPipe()) id: number,
  ) {
      console.log(id);
  }
//...
If a user sends the following HTTP request GET http://localhost:3000/users/1abc, the current parseIntPipe will validate the parameter. I think it's not the expected behaviour.
Proposal
This PR will improve the parseIntPipe by using the rxjs function isNumeric to be sure that the input string is only composed of numbers.
rxjs being already a dependency of nestjs, this PR doesn't add a new dependency.",5,7

What is the current behavior?
When a connected ClientGrpcProxy unsubscribes the Observable  returned for an stream gRPC method the upstream connection stays untouched and the server continuous to send updates, even if no-one's listening.
Likewise the Observables complete is not getting called.
Issue Number: #773
What is the new behavior?
When the client cancels the ServerGrpc stops consuming it's Observable and the client's complete gets called.
Also:

all eventListener on call get cleaned up
Argument type of getService<T> got tighten, as it can only be a keyof T - get more help from the comiler

Other information
I ❤️ NestJS and use it in our company in production. But we use RabbitMQ. It is one of popular message queue engine. It would be great if RQM transport  will become part of NestJS. It uses RPC pattern, in which we have one main queue which server (one or more instance) listens. When client sends message to main queue, it creates temporary queue in which it listens for an answer. This allow many clients communicate with server at ones.

You had old RQM example in your docs (as custom Strategy) that uses two queue, but we will run into issues if we have two different clients with different messages.
I covered code with test. Next step I'll write docs if pull request is useful for NestJS project.",10,35

What is the current behavior?

Issue Number: #1286
Issue Number: #1264
Previous PR: #1292
Currently when protobuf rpc is defined like this:
service TestService {
    rpc testMethod(stream TestMessage) returns (stream TestResponse)
}
Nest has no ability to pass a stream object down to the Controller handler, so there is no option to have full-duplex message interaction.
What is the new behavior?
Two new behaviors added, both are aiming same goals but serves different approach towards reaching the goal. Let's enumerate those:
RX Object approach
Developer receives RX object as the message and can return Promise or RX object as the stream
@Controller()
export class GrpcController {
  @GrpcStreamMethod('TestService')
    async testMethod(messages: Observable<TestMessage>): Promise<TestResponse> {
      // Form a resulting promise
      return new Promise<any>((resolve, reject) => {
        // Subscribe for a message to for a test answer
        messages.subscribe(msg => {
          // Resolve with iterating the value
          resolve({
            result: msg.data + 1
          });
        }, err => {
          reject(err);
        });
      });
    }
}
GRPC Call Object approach
Developer receives GRPC Stream wrapper and can operate it in the style of how streams are operated:
@Controller()
export class GrpcController {
    @GrpcStreamCall('TestService')
    async testMethod(stream: ClientWritableStream<TestResponse>) {
        stream.on('data', (msg: TestMessage) => {
            stream.write({result: msg.data + 1});
        }
    }

What is the current behavior?
At the moment ClientProxyFactory.create will always return the type ClientProxy & Closeable. Therefore it will not take the given transport option into consideration, even though we would know what type should be returned.
const client = ClientProxyFactory.create({ transport: Transport.GRPC, options: { ... }); // The type is `ClientProxy & Closeable`

// To get the correct type you have to use this workaround
const grpcClient = (client as any) as ClientGrpc;
On top of that ClientProxy & Closeable is straight up wrong with some clients, such as the GrpcClient.
Calling .connect() from ClientProxy & Closeable on ClientGrpc would result in this error: Error: The ""connect()"" method is not supported in gRPC mode.
What is the new behavior?
Adds overloads to the ClientProxyFactory for better type security.
This allows the user to not cast the client to any after creating it
using the factory.
const client = ClientProxyFactory.create({ transport: Transport.GRPC, options: { .. }) // The type is `ClientGrpcProxy`

What is the current behavior?
When trying to print the error it resolves to 'Error: [object Object]' which is unhelpful and means that the error objects are not serializable.
What is the new behavior?
This adds a toString() function to HttpException that will serialize only when the message is an object. It does not modify anything other than serialization of the error (which there was none)
Does this PR introduce a breaking change?
[ ] Yes
[ X ] No

The only potential breaking change is if some library somewhere expects the error to return [object Object] which would be an invalid use of this error.",4,6

What is the current behavior?
At the moment only OnApplicationShutdown exists, which gets called once the server stops taking any requests.
What is the new behavior?
BeforeApplicationShutdown gets called once an e.g. system signal got sent to the process, but the app still accepts any requests, as long as all BeforeApplicationShutdown-Promises have been resolved.
Does this PR introduce a breaking change?
[ ] Yes
[x] No

Other information
The shutdown order
- OnModuleDestroy: Use to clean up an injectable (unsubscribe Observables, etc.)
- BeforeApplicationShutdown: Gracefully shutdown all the services, but still send unavailable response codes
- OnApplicationShutdown: Shutdown all pending services

Being able to still process requests, even if a system signal has been sent, is crucial in Kubernetes.
@nestjs/terminus can be further improved once this PR gets merged. As soon as beforeApplicationShutdown gets called, Terminus will send unhealthy responses, notifying Kubernetes to switch out the Pod.
I will update the docs once this PR has been merged :)",5,7
