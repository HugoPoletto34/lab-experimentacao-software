they were added and find the first one that fit the description. While
this works in most cases, if a user wants to have overlapping zones, it
is better to iterate through all of them and find the zone that the user
expects. There are cases where a zone is completely inaccessible on drag
because of the current code. To resolve this, the zone search will look
for the smallest zone possible. The reason I chose this solution is
because this guarantees that zones are at least reachable since if a
zone was bigger than another zone, then there must be a part of it
that is exposed, therefore reachable itself. Note: this solution is for
the scenario between two zones. More than that is not guaranteed. But I
feel like this covers enough scenarios to warrant its addition.
Example:

Zone1        -





Zone2  -  -






Previously, zone2 was inaccessible since it would iterate through 1 then
2. But 1 would always be seen first when dragging a window. With this
fix it zone2 will be accessible.

Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments
One weird behaviour I noticed is after the fade out was implemented, the thumbnail of the monitor on the overlay seemed to have its alpha (opacity) value go from transparent to fully visible for a split second, and after that it faded out properly with the rest of the overlay. The same brief transparency flash was happening no matter how long I made the fade out animation. This was however fixed with changing the alpha values of two lines on 588 and 597. I could not figure this out but it only worked when the two lines were changed, changing one and not the other and vice versa didn't make any difference. Maybe someone can shed some light on this?
Validation Steps Performed
Tested the fade in and fade out manually on different animation speeds from very short (0.1 secs) to very long (10 secs).",3,4

The bug effects only multi monitor case where a monitor WorkArea coordinates may be different from {0,0}.

FZ Editor wasn't fitting small screens.

PR Checklist

 Closes #263 #442


Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments
This is just a quick fix to unblock users that have screen with a working area height less than 900px.
In that case the editor shows the layouts  horizontally and reduces the size of the squares.
We may revisit this fix to improve it since it has some limitations, for example the list of custom layouts will keep growing horizontally out of the screen area.
My proposal is to increase the current number of columns from 3 to 5 and use it on all monitors. We may also want to add a scrollbar.
I added the minimize button to the editor window, since on small screens it's very handy to not have the editor window covering most of the screen (on larger screens it doesn't hurt to have it as well).

Since winrt::com_ptr is akin to std::shared_ptr, it can cause memory leaks via circular references. We've had a FancyZones::m_zoneWindowMap field holding a reference to itself(this), preventing the destructor from running.

Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments
We never destroyed FancyZones object. The leak was happening because FancyZones had a field with a pointer to itself:

zoneWindow stores ref-counter pointer to a host, which is the actually FancyZones object
We store zoneWindow as part of a FancyZones::m_zoneWindowMap. winrt::com_ptr::copy_from is basically the same as shared_ptr copy ctor

So we need to clear the m_zoneWindowMap to break circularity.
I've also removed some of the com_ptrs fields, because now that we actually call ~FancyZones, it will free its FancyZones::m_settings member. But since FancyZones is being destroyed, that means we're in FancyZonesModule::destroy which has its own FancyZonesModule::m_settings. However, since FancyZones::FancyZones didn't share a refcount to the settings and instead did a m_settings.attach(settings);, we would crash in ~FancyZonesModule with a double free.
Same problem with a winrt::com_ptr<IFancyZonesCallback> m_callback basically.
Initial review was done by @bzoz, and he noticed that we would later may need to call set_config again after enable() in the runner.

Instead of just failing, if the runner can't get the Settings to run non-elevated, run it elevated and let the Settings handle that.
This is part one of the fix since the current way way of dropping elevated privileges in the Settings process doesn't work in this scenario. We'll make those changes in a different PR.

Updated the dllmain.cpp to match the PowerToys template, and added a Settings.cpp which mimics the settings codebase of PowerRename.
Currently the only setting which is implemented is Enabling/Disabling the PowerToy.
There is now a working ImageResizer which can be enabled/disabled with the PowerToy settings. It can currently be ""installed"" by the process described in the Validation Steps Performed section.
 
Future Changes to be made

Include ImageResizer in the installer
Renaming the files and projects to be consistent with other power toys code bases.

Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

Implemented the PowerToyModuleIface in dllmain.cpp
Added ShellExtensions.dll to the runner
Updated header files stdafx.h and targetver.h to build and mimic other power toys (if the version support was provided for WinXP as in the original image resizer code, the common/settings_objects.h cannot be used as it contains macros which aren't defined for WinXP.)
Added Settings.cpp and Settings.h which mimic PowerRename. A class with static methods is used and the settings are stored in registry instead of a JSON file. Since registry operations are atomic in Windows there is no issue of thread-safety.
The settings implemented so far are only the Enabled/Disabled flag for the powertoy as a whole. If ImageResizer is disabled, the ""Resize pictures"" option is removed from the context menu.
The changes in the vcxproj file and vcxproj.filters file are the addition of the new files(Settings.h and Settings.cpp).


Validation Steps Performed

Since the installer has not yet been updated, the following steps can be followed for testing the power toy:

Build the solution. This will automatically register the ShellExtensions.dll at HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers\Image Resizer. The Resize pictures option will now appear on the context menu when an image is right clicked, however it will fail as the exe file hasn't been linked yet.
Add registry entry for the ImageResizer.exe file at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\BriceLambson\ImageResizer with the string value as the path of the ImageResizer.exe generated from the build (src\modules\imageresizer\ImageResizer\bin\Debug\ImageResizer.exe). The Resize pictures option will work now.
Run PowerToys. The enable/disable ImageResizer option will work as expected.

We added the dialog box styles to the ""not zonable window"" filter, to prevent Save As.. and similar dialogs to be assigned to a zone. This caused a lot of apps that use dialog styles to not work with FancyZones. This PR removes those dialog box styles, since the ""window has no owner"" rule makes the actual dialog boxes not zonable.

Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

Details of how the context menu ordering works can be found in #1110
Based on the details above, since the ShellImagePreview which contains Rotate Left/Right is registered at HKCR/SystemFileAssociation/.png/ShellEx/ContextMenuHandlers/ShellImagePreview, the same has to be done with ImageResizer for each of the supported types. Thus there are entries for bmp, dib, gif, jfif, jpe, jpeg, jpg, jxr, png, rle, tif, tiff, wdp (all the directly supported types mentioned in the ImageResizer code). Images like .ico also ""work"" with the ImageResizer.exe but it converts it to jpg instead, so it doesn't actually resize a .ico back to .ico.
ShellImagePreview adds 4 entries: a separator, Rot right, Rot left and another separator. For a basic check without making the context menu handling more resource intensive, a simple check for a separator at the start index(indexMenu arg) has been added to make sure that if an older version of Windows is being used where ShellImagePreview isn't available or if it has been disabled the code will still run fine.
The drag and drop handler index was simply increased by one because Copy here was the initial first value in the context menu.

We need both of those .rc's for localization and dialog boxes to work. I've kept the boilerplate generated by VS's resource editor, so it doesn't get added automatically in the future etc.
The issue was caused by PowerRenameUWPUI using external resource file - PowerRenameUI.rc. It doesn't contain the IDS_POWERRENAME string which is responsible for the menu item title (see CPowerRenameMenu::GetTitle).
We cannot just simply use PowerRenameExt.rc instead which contains IDS_POWERRENAME, because we also need IDD_MAIN for the UI dialog, which is contained in the former file.
Therefore, I've created a new resource file for UWPUI project, which simply #includes both files mentioned above.

Initial implementation of #1020:

simple MessageBox-like toasts
toasts with multiple buttons with background activation and easy handler registration


PR Checklist

 Applies to #1020

Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments
PT is a Desktop Bridge app, not a true UWP app, because we need to run it full-trust to access numerous APIs and have compatibility with MSI. We might want to fully port it to UWP in the future, but as it currently is, the toast notifications' registration is done in a bit roundabout way.
We must implement IBackgroundTask as an in-proc activation server (WinRT analogue of in-proc COM server) if we want reacting to ToastNotification's actions while the PT isn't running.
Since IBackgroundTask implementation class should be in a WinRT component library to be built correctly, it must use the dynamic version of C/C++ runtime. That means it cannot link e.g. common libraries to it, since all PT's modules use static runtime instead. Moreover, it cannot be the activatable DLL directly, since in that case it must be linked to a true UWP app, otherwise we get an obscure error in the Event viewer while Windows was trying to launch our background task:

failed to activate with error code 0x8007007E

After some researching, I've discovered that it actually means that Windows uses WinRT analogue of regsvr32 to load notifications.dll and instantiate IBackgroundTask's class, but fails to do so because of missing msvcp140_app.dll and the like. Those libraries are UWP versions of C/C++ runtime and, as we imagine, shouldn't be distributed with our app directly. Since we're a Desktop Bridge app, dynamic loader isn't made aware of them, and we fail to load our DLL.
That brings us to the following design:

notifications is a static WinRT library with a dynamic C/C++ runtime which implements a single IBackgroundTask implementation class which serves as a dispatcher for all background tasks handlers
all actual handlers should be implemented in notifications library and registered via handler_functions.cpp:handlers_map
notifications_dll is a classic DLL library with a dynamic C/C++ runtime which implements some plumbing and avoids having to deal with 0x8007007E. we register it as a activator in manifest
common library and any other PT modules can use new notifications API functions for showing toasts using the src/common/notifications.h header

Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

The IsInterestingWindow method is moved ""as is"" to the FancyZones.cpp.
3 IsInterestingWindow calls were moved to the FancyZones.cpp in appropriate places
In 2 places in FancyZones.cpp where we used get_filtered_active_window() and GetWindow(window, GW_OWNER) calls, we now use IsInteresetingWindow.
The m_movedWindow is removed. It fixed an issue when a Chrom tab is dragged into another Chrome instance, the style would change so that the window would become uninteresting. FancyZones would be stuck in ""window is dragged mode"", so we kept a reference to the dragged window to make sure we disengage the display of the zones. In the FancyZones.cpp the reference is already kept in m_windowMoveSize, we will reuse it.
For #1182 we should probably not swallow the keyboard events. Excluded apps should probably be able to use regular Windows snapping.

No user content will be lost after applying these changes, since migration from registry to JSON is performed at startup (if detected that user is still using ""old"" storage). Human readable JSON files will make it easier for users to understand the behavior of FancyZones and if needed to change some settings directly inside the JSON file.
Communication between FancyZones module (C++) and editor window (C#) is done through temporary JSON files, where the editor always returns difference between old and new zone layout setup (changes invoked by user during activity in editor window). The FancyZones editor (C#) is no longer loading native FancyZones library (this was a requirement for future ARM support).
This applies to #368 and #390.

Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

Added ImageResizer files and dlls to MSIX packaging layout
Added ImageResizerExt.dll as SurrogateServer (ExeServer can't be used as there is no C++ exe for it).
Added a file explorer context menu entry to the appmanifest for *
Removed the registry key which stores the ImageResizer.exe file location from the MSI installer and made changes to the code so that the location of ImageResizer.exe is identified using the location of the module ImageResizerExt.dll.
Implemented IExplorerCommand interface methods which are required for MSIX.
Modified ResizePictures() method to be reusable for both MSI and MSIX builds.

Observed issues and workarounds

On adding the SurrogateServer, the icon failed to load. This happened because the current module in ContextMenuHandler.cpp is Dllhost.exe, and in the GetIcon function the icon was being retrieved from the current module. This was resolved by pointing to the module HINSTANCE of ImageResizerExt.dll instead.
Adding the ImageResizer fileExplorerContextMenus handler to a particular file type like .png instead of * resulted in very weird menu entry positioning, and it caused the ""Open"" entry to move down for some reason. A workaround was to set it as * instead of particular file types and filter for image file types within the GetState function in the code.
.png handler

* handler


Open Issues

The drag and drop handler does not appear on MSIX install.
The Resize pictures option does not appear with Rotate left/right (as in #1110 ). Unlikely to be fixable based on investigation for #1038 .

The cache was introduced to improve performance by not querying the OS for the window process path every time we need to check if the window is interesting to FancyZones. Since then other changes where made to the way we check the windows. Right now, the IsInterestingWindow function is called when:

WinKey + arrows are used
window is started to be dragged
window is created

1 and 2 are initiated by the user, happen only once per interaction so their performance impact can be dismissed. The 3) happens all the time, but for the most part the check for WS_CHILD or GetAncestor(window, GA_ROOT) == window will filter those out. In the end only top-level windows will be queried for their path.
Removing the cache improves code readability and will make code maintenance easier.
This PR only refactored the code used to filter the windows. It moved the logic from hwnd_data_cache to the get_filtered_base_window_and_path only dropping the caching of the executable path.

(This requires that #1223 lands first, relevant changes are in this commit) (edit: PR landed)
Splits the code use to filter windows for FancyZones and the ""active window"" for the ShortcutGuide. The FancyZones logic is preserved and merged into a single function. We keep it in common.h, as it might be also used in other PowerToys, like maximized to new desktop. We do however change the return type to be more descriptive. It also returns a separate flag for if the window has a visible owner. This can be used to implement the approved apps list.
For the ShortcutGuide, the logic is relaxed to include more windows. One example are Explorer properties windows. Those are (and should) filtered by the FancyZones, but should appear in the window preview in the SCG.
The new return type also includes information if the window will react to the default Windows Snap. This is not ideal though. Currently, SCG can only disable the entire ""Windows Controls"" group. OTOH windows like ""Save As..."" dialogs can be snapped to corners etc., but cannot be minimized nor maximized. Until SCG can separately disable those buttons we will display the buttons in the enabled state only if the window supports all settings. In the future, we should integrate FancyZones snap override here too.

Validation Steps Performed
As described by Raymond Chen, the main issue with attaching the input queue of another application, is that our thread could hang with the application we've attached to. To aid testing, I've developed a small test application which works in tandem with PowerRenameExt:

it locks a named mutex when launched
PowerRenameExt waits for this mutex to be unlocked until I've pressed a button in small application window: it stops the message pump loop (now we've ""stopped responding"") and unlocks the mutex. Pressing the button also brings the test app to the foreground.
PowerRenameExt attaches itself to the foreground thread from a different thread, which is killed after 10 seconds in case of hanging.

Actually, I've observed that even though I didn't process intentionally any messages in the test app, PowerRename didn't hang. Even though, we create a separate thread just in case. In the worst case scenario, we'll just remain in the background.",3,2

add a worker thread which periodically (currently once per 24h) checks if there's a new release available on GitHub
it checks if the current version string, obtained with get_product_version(), isn't equal to the tag_name (the actual git tag) from the latest release obtained using GitHub API, so we must be VERY CAREFUL when submitting stuff on /releases pages, because users will always be getting a notification if the tag doesn't match
if a new version is found, we offer a user to go to its download page, e.g. for v0.14.1
the last time we've checked for updates or showed a user the update dialog is tracked in a separate file at %localappdata%\Microsoft\PowerToys\update_state.json to not mix it with general settings and be able to save/load it safely anytime
VERSION_BUILD isn't used in get_product_version anymore, also it now returns a version prepended with 'v' to much with git tags notation we have so far (e.g. v0.14.1). We still have another zero in PRODUCTVERSION/FILEVERSION macros to make WinAPI happy

Once we've added support for toast notifications in non-packaged applications, we can use a toast instead.

Implemented the fix for the foreground issue (#1273) using the same approach that @yuyoyuppe used in #1282, however in case of ImageResizer the UI is in WPF so it required using the Win32 functions from user32.dll. For this a Win32Helpers.cs file was added which contains the win32 functions required for this fix.
Also added a comment to cross reference the code with this issue so that it can be removed later once resolved externally.

It was harder to verify that the fix works for ImageResizer as earlier the issue what happen sometimes but not always like how PowerRename did. This was probably because ImageResizer was launched in a separate process using its executable from the Shell Extension.
I tried right-click launching resize pictures >10 times and all those times it was in the foreground. The best case which can be used to reproduce the issue in the original code is to open a file explorer window across two monitors with a larger part in the second monitor (so it appears in the taskbar of the second monitor) and then open the context menu. This had a higher chance of replicating the issue.",2,0

This PR adds the resources.dll files for each language in the MSI installer. For example the Imageresizer.resources.dll for french is stored in modules\fr\ImageResizer.resources.dll as this is the location recognized by the C# executable. A similar step will have to be done for FancyZonesEditor when it is translated (@crutkas note this would be needed later on for #199 for any C# projects. ImageResizer already has almost all the strings translated).

This PR also changes the ImageResizer registry entries to HKCU so that they are installed per user instead of per machine.

I added a wrapper around the existing C++ IPC library using ATL to re-use the same methods and workflow in C#.
Other Attempts made were C++/CLI CLR but could not continue with it as the dependant library uses mutex (and other libraries) which is not supported in CLR which I would have had to implement IPC messaging for myself.

For future proposals:

Deprecating the two_way_pipe_message_ipc.h implemented in win32 and use the .NET Core IPC Interop library which can be used both in C# and C++.
Here is a link with reasons why we should use C++/CLI CLR: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1874783/what-are-the-situations-or-pros-and-cons-to-use-of-c-cli-over-c-sharp

this reorganization helps to keep all build artifacts in one place out of src folder
it's also easier to see what files each project produces and remove all build artifacts manually in one move

We still observe some .lib/.pdb/.../ stuff in the output folder and can't just tell the installer to simply package everything (*) in a x64\Release folder, because that would require introducing too many custom rules for each new project and is kinda error-prone anyway (e.g. including unwanted build artifacts to the installer by accident)

Click Edit Shortcuts. Clicking the + Sign will allow you to add a new shortcut. The shortcut can be removed by clicking the delete button.
Press Type shortcut to detect your shortcut. As of now the key name will not be displayed, only the code.
In the current version, only 2 key shortcuts will be applied. A check has not been added for the order of the keys in the UI, so while testing it make sure the modifier key is clicked first. Example: Ctrl+A and not A+Ctrl.
Clicking Apply will save the settings and your shortcuts will be remapped. If any of remaps were invalid, the valid ones will still apply, however a warning will be displayed on the top right corner.
Clicking Cancel will simply exit the window. If Apply was not clicked prior to clicking cancel then those shortcuts will not be saved.

Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

As described in that comment, we cannot detect if the Shift key is being held while an elevated window is active due to UIPI Windows security feature, so the toast notification is shown as soon as we drag an elevated window even w/o actually holding the Shift key.
We need to store ""Don't show again"" flag state somewhere. UWP API offers a convenient key-value storage, but unfortunately it's not usable for unpackaged apps (throws ""The process has no package identity.""), so we use the same mechanism as SHMessageBoxCheck - the registry.
Since we use the registry, we must introduce a custom URI scheme protocol which will be handled by a PowerToys.exe, because notifications library, being C++/WinRT project, doesn't support any legacy APIs such registry manipulation, so we can't use a background handler to update the flag state.


Validation Steps Performed

MSI works as admin/nonadmin (i.e. toast isn't shown when the window is draggable)
MSIX works (via virtualized registry)

 CLA signed. If not, go over here and sign the CLA
 Tests passed


Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

Generalized the shortcut code to work for shortcuts greater than 2 keys
Removed the ""Shortcut must be exactly 2 keys"" constraint on the Edit Shortcuts UI. The only constraint as of now is that the shortcut must be atleast 2 keys.
Added a function in the shortcut code to check if any other keys are pressed apart from the shortcut. This was required because in the previous version of the code, if the user remaps Ctrl+C to Ctrl+V and the user pressed Ctrl+Shift+C the system would get Ctrl+Shift+V, whereas Ctrl+Shift+C is actually a different shortcut. By checking that no other keys are pressed when Ctrl+C is pressed we can ensure to remap the exact shortcut instead of all shortcuts which contain it.
Summary of the remap algorithm (also present in comments across the code):

Check for the last key in the original shortcut. If all the modifier keys are also pressed down and no other keys are pressed, then clear out all the original shortcut keys and set the new shortcut keys as pressed down.
There are 4 cases to be handled if the shortcut has been pressed down

The user lets go of one of the modifier keys - reset the keyboard back to the state of the keys actually being pressed down (original shortcut keys except the one which was released)
The user keeps the shortcut pressed - the shortcut is repeated (for example you could hold down Ctrl+V and it will keep pasting)
The user lets go of the last key - reset the keyboard back to the state of the keys actually being pressed down (original shortcut except the last key)
The user presses another key while holding the shortcut down - the system now sees all the new shortcut keys and this extra key pressed at the end. Not handled as resetting the state would trigger the original shortcut once more




Note: In all the steps above, an extra check has been added to avoid resetting the state and resending key events for keys which are common between the two shortcuts. The code would still work fine without this, but to minimize latency the lesser the number of SendInput events the better.


Validation Steps Performed

Not sure if the sidepanel should live in the ShellPage or on the separate pages. Makes it easier for the VisualState/resizing stuff.
Do we have a control that we can re-use across settings / editor that take in hot-keys? Would be nice to have something that is in terms of visual style and behavior the same across all apps.

This PR adds thread safety to the shared variables between the Keyboard Manager backend and the UI. For most of the shared variables, the locks have been accessed in the member functions itself, to ensure each member function is thread safe. For the maps which store the remapping of keys/shortcuts, the mutexes were made public since the code in dllmain uses the maps in many lines of code, thus refactoring them into member functions would be worse in this situation.
Also fixed a bug in the detect key window, where key up strokes were also being detected.

The current fix is to just add all the unlocalized English strings (in this case the strings that we added), to all the string tables of different languages as well. Based on my investigation there is no way to have some global strings which are in English while also have a string table with some localized strings (in case of IR the ""Resize pictures"" is already localized in the rc file). The only solutions until we have translated versions are either add the english version to all the string tables or comment out the translated string tables so only english is supported
Changes
Since the diff view for the rc file is not visible, the changes made in the file are like this.

For each language's string table (Chinese in the above image for example) I added the last 4 english strings (since we don't have translated versions of them).

When two windows have the same name, they are considered ""duplicates"" and one of them is thrown out. The proper behavior that this PR implements is to check their window handles as well to see if they are the same windows.

When creating virtual desktop, FZ clones layout from it's parent desktop.
This fixes the bug where cloning also happened on switching (to already existing) VD and that switched-to-VD had no layout applied. So if there was NO layout applied on purpose, we don't want cloning to occur, but leave that VD with NO layout applied.

Following scenario is fixed:

Clean zones-settings - so there is no layout applied on primary desktop
Run PT and without applying any layout create new VD
Apply any layout to VD (e.g. PriorityGrid with 5 zones)
Go back to primary desktop

Use persistent json data file for storing PowerRename settings instead of registry. Currently whenever we call settings object to get / set certain setting we read / write from registry. Getting settings with new implementation won't require any IO operation, data is loaded from json formatted file on the startup. Settings are saved to file when certain settings change and when disabling PowerRenam / closing PowerToys. Migration of settings from registry is supported.
Most recently used list of search and replace strings will be implemented using json storage in follow up pull request.
Example json file:

This PR refactors the data structures used for Shortcut remaps. Earlier a vector of keys was used, however this had many issues w.r.t constraining the order of keys in the UI, constraining the type of keys used in the shortcut and supporting left/right versions of modifiers.
This PR adds a Shortcut class instead which contains function wrappers for all shortcut key related logic, while maintaining most of the actual remap logic in dllmain.cpp

Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

Added a Shortcut class, which stores all the modifiers and the action key associated with the shortcut. It also contains member functions for converting to virtual key codes, converting to string, and other remapping logic functions.
Added a RemapShortcut class. Earlier the std::map used was std:map<vector, pair<vector, bool>>. To clean this up, it is now std:map<Shortcut, RemapShortcut> where RemapShortcut consists of a Shortcut (the target shortcut), a bool variable (for checking if the shortcut was invoked), and a ModifierKey value to check which Windows key was pressed. The last is required to handle shortcut remaps which can work for either win key (there is no virtual key code for a common win key like that which exists for Ctrl, Alt, Shift). This value is used to remember which Win key was pressed when the shortcut was invoked. It is kept in this RemapShortcut class and not in the shortcut class itself since the key object in an std::map must be const and cannot be modified.
The Shortcut class now allows all modifiers to have displayable name based on whether it was left or right (example LCtrl or RCtrl) and a common one as well (Ctrl).
Common versions of all modifiers have been implemented. A user can now use Ctrl+A rather than LCtrl+A specifically. This is however not yet accessible on the UI since the detect key window won't show that according to the spec. By making the common ctrl key work on the backend this allows the drop down UI work for shortcuts.
A DecodeKey function has been added in Shortcut class which converts the key code to the key name. This currently only shows a name for modifier keys since those are fixed. This function would have to be moved out later since it isn't specific for shortcuts. This will be done when the keyboard unicode mapping code is integrated.
RCtrl and RAlt have not yet been handled correctly (to be done in another PR).
The changes should improve performance a bit for remapping since fixed size objects are now used instead of dynamic vectors.

OpenWindows.cs : bool WindowEnumerationCallBack(IntPtr hwnd, IntPtr lParam)
Listing apps was modified in order to detect Alt-Tab applications including UWP and also excluding cloaked UWP apps (running in background) which is also a condition that is assigned to Win32 applications running in another Virtual Desktop.
Window.cs
Added IsWindow to determine whether the window handle identifies an existing window.
Added IsWindowCloaked to detect a window has been suppressed from the screen by the shell.
InteropAndHelpers.cs
Added require DLLImports in order to changes work.
WinAPI added:

GetWindow, enum included GetWindowCmd for the relationship
GetWindowLong, included constants and enums for its parameters like GWL_EXSTYLE and the flags to test against in ExtendedWindowStyles. e.g. WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW and WS_EX_APPWINDOW are flags that determine the listing of windows in Alt-Tab
IsWindow, to determine if handle is a window
GetProp, to retrieve a property list of the window, specifically ITaskList_Deleted which many applications use when they hide temporarily like for systray or a hotkey show/hide.
DwmGetWindowAttribute, to detect cloaked windows, as mentioned by Mr. Raymond Chen about the correct way to detect suppressed windows from screen by the shell

Changes made in this PR are as follows -

Fix for Indexer throws out of bounds exception when search keyword starts with '*'
Removed the reference to pattern which was adding regex search functionality and instead added an asterisk at the start of every keyword. This generates the correct SQL query programmatically using the GenerateSQLFromUserQuery.
Unexpected search results when searching for folder/file - Fixed this by using the System.FileName Windows Property instead of System.Title.
Spaces are treated as AND and search results quality is improved.

 CLA signed. If not, go over here and sign the CLA


Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

When the detect single key/shortcut content dialog is created, two KeyDelays objects are registered to track the Escape and Enter keys.
For each KeyDelay object, three callbacks are provided, one for Short Press, and two for Long Press (when pressed initially and when released).
Long Press triggers when the user holds the key for more that 0.9 seconds.
When the callback function needs to close the window, the UnregisterKeyDelay code should be run from a different thread, otherwise there would be a deadlock.
The Detect shortcut content dialog takes into account single key remapping when tracking Escape and Enter.

Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

Key list is arranged as Modifier keys, character keys, special keys (like Enter, Space, etc) and then unknown keys (which dont have a name just a virtual code). We can choose to not show the unknown keys in the future. In case of Edit shortcuts there is an additional ""None"" key at the start which is used to remove the drop down.
Since in the current key names some key representations could be repeated (for example there are two / keys on the keyboard), key selections are made with a second vector which has the corresponding virtual key code for each key name, rather than searching from the keyboard map. This way we ensure a one-to-one mapping since we search index to key code and not key name to key code.
KeyType helper functions added to categorize keys depending on the type of modifier or if it is an action key.
Flyout warnings have been added to manage all the scenarios in the drop down input for Edit Shortcuts. These include warnings for making sure that there is atleast 2 keys, there must be exactly one action key, there needs to be a modifier key, action key must be at the end, and a modifier cannot be repeated (example LCtrl and RCtrl).
Changed the logic for creating the custom controls to dynamic allocation using unique_ptr since there were cases where the objects were going out of scope and variables were being referenced to result in garbage values.

This PR adds a check for extended keys which include RAlt and RCtrl. For these keys an extended key flag is included during SendInput in order to work properly. If that wasn't added you would get weird behaviour if you remapped LShift to RCtrl, held down LShift and switch to another window and then release LShift, it would act as if RCtrl was still held down.
Another issue that was fixed was for shortcuts containing Ins, Home, Pg keys, Del, End and Arrow keys. It was observed that the shortcuts would not get remapped if Num lock was turned on. It turns out that this was because for shortcut remappings we ensure that no other key states are set to ""down"" but when num lock is pressed, an undocumented 0xFF is set to down. Now we don't check the 0xFF key code.

Current Design is to save the configuration independent from the settings.json in a separate file config-name.json. This will be make the support of multiple configuration easier and configurations file can be shared or use templates.
Added a fake Key Code to represent equivalent to VK_WIN.
Current Design is updating a dummy settings-updated.json to communicate to Settings process that the config json have been successfully updated so settings process can read the file. The reason for using because FileSystemWatcher raises trigger events multiple time during a file update and the settings process have no knowledge if the runner process is still writing to the file. Alternatively, a polling approach can be used here as well to retry after sometime to see if file is free.
FileSystemWatcher fires multiple events on writing to a file. Added a logic to treat all the events fired with a Time threshold as one.

Remapping the common version of Ctrl/Alt/Shift behaves differently from other keys since clicking those keys those not actually result in a VK_CONTROL, VK_MENU and VK_SHIFT. Those key codes can be used in SendInput or GetAsyncKeyState but they are not naturally generated on key press (only the L or R version is generated). To solve this without modifying the remap logic, we tweak the remappings while saving and loading on the UI.
Example:
If user chooses to remap Alt -> A on the UI, we store LAlt -> A and RAlt -> B in the map.
While loading the existing maps into the UI, we check if LAlt and RAlt are both remapped, and if they are remapped to the same key then we combine them to Alt while showing them in the UI. This also makes it more consistent. However on the UI someone may still remap both LAlt and Alt, this has not been blocked. In this case whichever is first gets priority. If LAlt, is first then the LAlt remapping is applied and the RAlt is remapped to whatever Alt was remapped to. If Alt is first then both are remapped to the same value.

This PR fixes an issue where the key name list would change depending on if Caps Lock, Shift, etc were toggled.
The ToUnicodeEx function takes the keyboard state as argument, and earlier we were getting this using GetKeyboardState. This can be avoid by passing an array with all values set to 0, so that it considers no key to be pressed. As suggested by @saahmedm in #2198, I have only set the Caps Lock to be on, so that in case of English we get capital letters for the key names. This would have different effects on other languages (In French for example, Caps Lock behaves like Shift and gives the second character for all characters including symbols/numbers).

KBM Common output dir changed to modules/.
KBM UI project was earlier a DLL. This had to be changed to a static lib (following the approach taken by PowerRename and other powertoys), since only the main extension dll gets loaded from the runner, and this fails if the KBMUI dll file is not in the same folder as the runner exe file. Another workaround would be to add a LoadLibrary call in the runner, but that would involve too many changes to common PowerToys code. The output dir was also changed to modules/
After changing the folders and compiling there were some runtime errors occuring with the to_hstring function when directly with constant strings (example: to_hstring(L""Type key"")). While checking this I observed to_hstring was actually not needed, as wchar strings can get automatically type casted by functions requiring hstring as argument. All those unnecessary to_hstring calls were removed.

This is happening because of the code in the shell plugin.
The Shell plugin has it's own code to override the Win+R key and because of the way they are creating and handling hooks, once we press Win+R, the Win key must be pressed again to release it. So basically, they're trying to simulate the Win key press, however since simulating only the win key press would pop up the start menu, they are simulating Win+Ctrl which is the same shortcut as that of ww.

To unblock us and mitigate this issue for now, I used the BackSpace keystroke instead of Control, so we would be simulating a Win+BackSpace keystroke.
NOTE Wox uses NHotkey.wpf nuget package for handling hotkeys and we would like the code for modifying hotkeys to be the same across all of powerToys and as that involves major code refactoring it would be done for v1.

This was changes to the SystemBaseLowColor theme resource (which matches the same color in light theme and had a corresponding dark theme variant as well). This does not get refreshed when the OS theme is changed, however the moment another key is clicked the correct color is loaded.
For the Hold Enter to exit animation, we were changing the OK button to dark gray. This was changed to SystemBaseMediumLowColor.

Adding a right margin to the gridview so buttons don't push up against the edge.

The grid view items also add a bit of padding veritcally.  46 is a value that adds some buffer to the height of the buttons but includes enough room for margins).

This PR changes the approach of adding the controls on the edit keyboard and edit shortcut window from stack panels to a single grid with three columns.

Edit keyboard and Edit shortcut header changed to relative layout
3 column Grid used for all the key/shortcut controls
Instead of using a fixed row index, the row index is now calculated based on the index of the control in the grid in the UI. Since these indices are reliable and match what is shown on the UI, the index will always match the buffer vector where the values are stored.
Moved drop down selection handlers out of the constructor to a separate function. This was done since all the associated controls may not be initialized at the constructor stage (some stack panels in the parent class would be null).
Changed the C++ window logic to account for resizing. Earlier only on the WM_PAINT message the Xaml UI would be resized. However that message is not sent if the window is resized smaller. That has now been fixed.

Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

VK_WIN_BOTH moved from KBM Constants to shared constants in common so that it can be used in keyboard_layout.cpp
Similar to the handling for Alt, Ctrl, and Shift in #2217 , for single key remaps for Win key the same behaviour has been followed, i.e. remapping Win to something is equivalent to remapping both LWIN and RWIN to that key. For remaps from something to Win key, we handle it by considering the target key to be LWin since the VK_WIN_BOTH is a fake key code (unlike that used for Alt, Ctrl and Shift).
For shortcuts where remap is from Win + something, we have an additional flag in the RemapShortcut class (added in an earlier PR) which is used to remember which win key was pressed (L or R). This information is required since we need to reset the state of the key which the user presses and we cannot default to LWin, since that would result in reseting LWin while the user is pressing down RWin. For remaps to Win + something, we simply use LWin. If the shortcut is from one win shortcut to another then the corresponding pressed win key is used.",2,0

Instead of empty GUID, take first GUID from list of virtual desktops (available in Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\VirtualDesktops). In order to make this backward compatible, migration of old persisted JSON data which is stored for empty GUID desktops is implemented. On initialization sequence this all JSON data is modified and saved again to file.

Similar to #2147 and #2302 , this PR adds all the necessary files for KBM and SettingsV2 to the MSI installer. Currently for .NET Core projects (in this PR's case it is the Settings.UI.Runner project), in order to get all the dependencies you have to Publish the project. The settings used for Publish were Framework Dependent, Win-x64. Confirmed the above works with both ReadyToRun enabled or disabled.
Note: Based on the structure of the SettingsV2 output files, the MSI will have to be updated for each new View page or Control that is added to the UI.

This PR removes all the earlier warning messages from flyouts and now uses an Error icon with a tooltip of the error message. The reason for this is because Flyouts interrupt user input, so by moving the warning to a hidden tooltip, its less intrusive for the user. The PR also adds handling for remapping a key/shortcut to itself, remapping a key/shortcut twice, conflicting remaps (like Ctrl (Left) and Ctrl) and Win L and Ctrl Alt Del remaps. The only flyouts that have been maintained for now are on the Apply button. The key order was also modified to improve search.

Things that can be improved

While moving to the tooltip based warning makes it less blocking for the user, we should still make it more visible for the user. Maybe like a red colored icon, or if possible the tooltip should force show up without hover so that the user notices it.
Another option is to show a warning next to which ever key/shortcut is giving an error, rather than a single one for the whole row. That way the mouseover point will be close to where the error occured.
Currently if there is an error in both shortcuts in a row, we update the tooltip with the latest error. The warning should be improved to list out all the issues in the shortcuts rather than the latest applied one.


Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

Reordered the keys in drop down as the following groups:

Numbers/Alphabets/Symbols
Modifiers
Other named keys
Unknown keys
Each of the above groups are sorted in alphabetical order to improve search as suggested by @traies and @saahmedm


Removed flyouts and changed to a warning symbol with tooltip. This makes it easier for the user to search without being blocked by the flyout popping up.
A warning was also added for incomplete remapping (where a shortcut is incomplete or a row in the remap is incomplete), but this warning is only showed when pressing apply, so that the user does not see an incomplete warning while adding a new row. Also this helps is pointing out which remaps were unsuccessful when the remap partially fails
Constraint on number of keys for shortcut that can be added from UI changed from 5 to 3.


Validation Steps Performed
Run and add different types of shortcuts, both using drop downs and by type shortcut. Same for key remapping.

Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments.

It became apparent when using the arrow keys to update the query text programatically, that there were holes in the logic to prevent updating the query when we change the text.  To fix this it was broken into to TextChanged event handlers one to deal with programatic input and the other to deal with user text changes.  Because the property changed event and the text changed are on different dispatchers, we can't check the boolean flag inside the event handler.

Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments
This is not perfect.  We get multiple  writes on installing or uninstalling the uwp app.   The idea is an initial write will trigger a timed delay of the reindex, if another write is detected within that time span it resets the timer.   If the install has delays between file writes we will reindex multiple times (not good).
Also there seems to be thread contention that causes stalls if we are querying for apps while the UWP apps are being reindexed.

Once this is confirmed to work, we can do the same for the launcher project as well.

PR Checklist
This PR fixes multiple undocumented issues:

The main build pipeline fails because of missing dependencies for the MSI.
This possibly fixes the Xaml Island double compile issue (to be verified by more users)


Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments


Since dotnet publish CLI was always failing for the Settings.UI UWP project (according to the official github repo, some functionality in VS steps is not present in dotnet CLI), I used MsBuild instead, because VS uses MsBuild internally


For compiling correctly with MsBuild in the interop project a reference to common projects file had to be removed and was changed to a path based reference rather than project based reference. I am not sure why normally building with VS doesn't throw a warning or error about the same.


There was a missing file in the UWP project which existed but was not referenced in the project.


The script in short runs a MSBuild publish task (which internally does build followed by publish). Some extra code had to be added to ensure it doesnt run into a recurse loop, since the msbuild task is a post build event.


For publishing, a publish profile file needs to be created, that has been hardcoded into the script.


For changing the MSI from its current behaviour to self-contained we would have to change one parameter in the script, as well as add the extra dll files created into the Wix toolset file.


Since the script code is only readable when opening it in VS here is the code

I got it to stop crashing by bypassing XamlBridge Window focus handling.
It seems there was some initialization missing that was the root cause of the strange crashes in Windows Insiders.

Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

Xaml Bridge seems to not handle focus events properly, so this fix just bypasses it by handling the WM_SETFOCUS event directly.
This also solves another not documented crash that involved minimizing the window, then closing by pressing the X button without interacting with the window content itself.
Solved by calling winrt::init_apartment and WindowsXamlManager::InitializeForCurrentThread() in the constructor of the XamlBridge class.

Click on the Remap a key button with no key remappings.

The crash mentioned in the linked issue was happening because we use a single KeyboardManagerState variable for both of the windows, so when one of the windows is closed there is most likely something getting set to nullptr while a window is still open. The way the code was written was considering only one window open, so the best way to solve this with minimal changes is to ensure only one window can be opened at a time.
The PR changes the behavior of the buttons, such that when clicking either of the buttons - if Edit keyboard or edit shortcut either of them are open, it will bring that window in focus. Earlier if Edit keyboard was open and you clicked the same button again, it would just bring that to focus. By this change we ensure that only one window is open at a time, and by bring that in focus the user should also notice the window lying open.
This is a first step for #2466 . The pending work for the modal dialog is to prevent the user from being able to access the Settings window while this dialog box is up.
This also adds a fix where the remap button would stop working if you closed KBM from the taskbar (the runner would not crash though).

This PR makes the following changes:

On the Edit Keyboard screen, key remappings are not applied, so even if the user has orphaned a key, then can still search with it in the drop down menu
On the Edit Shortcuts screen, shortcut remappings are not applied, so even if the user has orphaned a shortcut, then can still use it on that window. This is for consistency with the above behavior.
Commented out App-Specific and ToggleKeyToModifier handlers in the back-end (even though they wouldn't technically do anything unless they were in the settings). This can be uncommented when we add in the feature to the UI.

Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments
Tests were failing because GeneralSettings uses the interop library to get version information. interop is a C++/CLI project, and can't be called by an UWP app. This is not a problem in the Settings.UI exe because we are using XamlIslands, but thats not so in the UnitTests.
The current fix is just to handle the exception, which solves the crashes that happened in the UnitTest project.
A more permanent solution could be to set up the UnitTest project in a similar fashion to the Main application, that is, by having a .NET Core runner invoking a XamlIsland.

This PR mitigates the double compile issue for settings and launcher. The issue that F5 does a build even when there is no change in files still exists however.
The PR currently removed the publish post build events and instead adds publishing as pre-build events in the installer project
Details of the PR

Removed post-build events in Settings and Launcher
Disabled IncrementalClean targets for Settings and Launcher
Updated Wox project output directories to separate directories to avoid clash with PowerLauncher.csproj output
Added the telemetry dlls for Launcher and Settings introduced in #2696 to the MSI.
Removed the Wox json files and the PowerLauncher.runtimeconfig.dev.json from the MSI since those are not used. The runtimeconfig.dev.json contains file paths for the local nuget packages on the machine so those should not be included in MSI, they are only there for functioning on the dev machine.
Added the following command line pre-build events to PowerToysSetup project


Creates pubxml publishing profile based on the required parameters (using a publish profile is the only way and recommended way for publishing .NET Core projects).


Publishes the .NET Core project based on those parameters


The same is repeated for Settings and Launcher.

Known issues

By disabling IncrementalClean, Clean Solution no longer cleans the Settings project or the Launcher project and cleaning Settings/Launcher projects don't work either. A separate issue can be created for this and it may be possible to fix this by tweaking the target conditions (enabling incremental clean only for the Clean target).
#2758 still exists on the build farm. I think the quickest way to unblock this would be to move FZ dlls to a separate folder.
Even if there are no changes in the project, F5 still does some building for Settings/Launcher, but it is quicker than before

The following considerations were made in this PR

To be backwards compatible with .17 we need to serialize and deserialize as a BoolProperty.   I've added a BoolPropertyJsonConverter to serialize and deserialize bool Properties as the BoolProperty type.
Because we want to detect when the EnableSvg and EnableMarkdown properties are set we don't want to expose this type to calling methods.  Eg. Settings.properties.EnableSvg.Value = value; becomes Settings.properties.EnableMd = value; and we don't interact with the BoolProperty directly.


Validation Steps Performed
Installed .17:

Verified that the settings are loaded into settings v2.

Toggling EnableSvg and EnableMarkdown settings and verified.

Telemetry Events are fired for both.
Settings are serialized in the same format:

This PR reverts the warning system to flyouts since most of the bug bash feedback revolved around warnings not being visible/noticeable. The main issue with the flyout system was that drop downs were almost unusable since searching on them would trigger flyouts even if you dont select them.

PR Checklist

 Applies to #2778 , #2665

Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

Removed the warning exclamation icon
Added the old flyout design for warnings introduced in #2140
The main issue with the flyouts was that it made searching in drop downs very difficult. The ComboBox.SelectionChanged handler gets called even when searching in the drop down and a selection is highlighted. This would cause the flyout to appear and it would close the drop down. This caused issues such that if the user cannot type A because it's the first drop down, they could not search for Alt either since A would be the first selection and the flyout would pop up.
Based on an idea from this stackoverflow answer, I moved the selection handler to the ""Drop Down closed"" event. By doing this the selection logic and validation of the shortcut is done only when the drop down is closed, so searching is not affected by this. This however would not work for the following two scenarios:


The user uses Type Key/shortcut to enter a key/shortcut and presses OK. In this case the drop downs get populated but it is never opened/closed so that method would not get triggered
When opening remap key/shortcuts if you have old remappings then those would have to be reloaded. Again in this case dropdownClosed is not triggered.
If the user has keyboard focus on the combo box and just types in something, dropDownClosed isnt triggered.


To handle the above to cases we have to use the SelectionChangedHandler, however we have to ensure we only do this only for those cases. This is done by checking if the drop down is currently closed. This encompasses all the above cases and the only case where it still happens apart from the above list is if we SetSelectedIndex from within the DropDownClosed handler. Since we only set it to -1 there, and we chave checked for SelectedIndex !=-1 in the selectionchanged logic this is not a problem. All other cases where you have to open the drop down and you click something do not trigger SelectionChanged because SelectionChanged is called first, then the dropDownClosed handler is called, so the drop down is considered open during that.
After switching to the flyout case there was one bug with using None. If you would set None and the drop down gets deleted but the resulting shortcut has a conflict with another shortcut then an error would occur because a flyout would try to open on that deleted drop down. This has been resolved by doing the drop down deletion only after ensuring that there are no other errors/conflicts if that drop down was removed.


Validation Steps Performed
Validated all the error messages still appear as before and ensured that warnings appear as they should when using the following:

Type Shortcut/Key
Opening remap keyboard/shortcuts with old remappings and just clicking apply should maintain all the remappings (to ensure selection handlers are correctly called)
Using the entire UI both using keyboard and using keyboard+mouse and navigating with the drop down and searching using them.",2,1

Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments
The definition for the IZoneSet interface was updated but in a way that should not impact any existing code. An overload param with default value was added to the existing AddZone method for use with the grid and priority grid layouts.
I didn't want to change the actual arrangement of zones in any way as this would require changes in the fancy zones editor to be made as well.
I feel as though above 7 zones the defined layouts may be inideal for most users. I only really imagine users with ultrawide monitors ever using this and some of the decisions such as there being 4 even rows don't seem desireable. Perhaps the userbase should be surveyed on this feature.
That being said, it seems like some future work in the pipeline may invalidate this layout completely, what's the point in a priority zone that's two rows wide when you can stretch a window across multiple zones?

In the event the runner takes time to launch the Settings UI, and if the user clicks the launch icon again while the runner is in the process of launching the first window, the runner will create another process to launch another settings window.

This PR fixes an issue where typing keys with longer names would overflow on the Type Shortcut UI. This has been fixed with the following changes:

Shortened some unnecessarily long key names
Added a second stack panel row, such that when more than 3 keys are entered they are added to the second row - the stack panel is hidden if there are 3 keys or lesser that have been pressed so that the double margin does not appear.

The changes only affect UI and makes no change to the actual logic in shared info between the threads.
Note: Couldn't use text wrapping to do the second row method, because a stack panel cannot be wrapped since it extends based on the content. The other alternative would be to add a max width to each textblock and wrap each of them but that would appear worse.

This PR changes the type key and type shortcut behavior to hold enter to accept instead of hold and release, so that it is consistent with the Esc behavior. It was also observed that in tab ordering for Remap Keyboard and Remap Shortcuts windows the Cancel key would get highlighted before OK which is not in the Left to Right order, so that has been swapped.

Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

The onAccept lambda was split into two parts, onPress and onRelease
In onPress we perform all the accept logic followed by detectKeyBox.hide() but we do not perform the ResetUIState and unregisterkeys()
The resetting of UI state along with disabling the key delay handler is done in onRelease. Because of this, we stop swallowing input only when Enter key is released, and this allows us to avoid the issue where pressing Enter triggers the Type key button again.
onPress is performed in case of the long press delay handler (along with the primary button color change even though that would appear for just a few milliseconds but the user can notice it)
onRelease is performed in case of the key release delay handler so that when user lets go of Enter key everything in the KBM state is cleared up
We define onAccept as onPress followed by onRelease so that primary button click behavior remains unchanged

This PR makes the scroll viewer scroll to the bottom whenever a new remap is added. This hack works for now since the Add button is at the bottom, but we would want to remove this when we decide the correct positioning for the button.

Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments
We need to launch custom action TerminateProcesses on update/uninstall, so it doesn't have Installed condition. It's implemented as a C++ CA instead of using util:CloseApplication, because I was keep getting this error:
MSI (s) (EC!AC) [11:49:03:171]: Product: PowerToys (Preview) -- The installer has encountered an unexpected error installing this package. This may indicate a problem with this package. The error code is 2762. The arguments are: , , 

Action ended 11:49:03: WixCloseApplicationsDeferred. Return value 3.
WixCloseApplications:  Error 0x80070643: Failed MsiDoAction on deferred action

even though I've tried various combinations of ElevatedCloseMessage/RebootPrompt argument values. In short, scheduling WixCloseApplications before InstallInitialize was breaking the installer, but scheduling it after it wasn't sufficient, since the dialog from #2887 is generated during InstallValidate, which runs before InstallInitialize.
We also need certain logic of terminating the process: first we send WM_CLOSE, then we wait for a timeout value and terminate the process. This ensures that .NET core dlls are unloaded and we don't encounter #2887. I was getting the prompt w/o the timeout even when sending WM_CLOSE messages first.

This PR makes the following changes:

Set treat warnings as errors for all 3 KBM projects. Warning 4002 had to be disabled for these projects as it is a known bug in Xaml Islands (warning C4002: too many arguments for function-like macro invocation 'GetCurrentTime')
Moved all additional functions in dllmain except the base HandleKeyboardHookEvent to a KeyboardEventsHandler header file. This includes the singlekey remap handler and shortcut remap handlers. Other functions like SetKeyEvent and GetCurrentApplication were moved to Helpers.h in the KeyboardManagerCommon project.
Moved constants that were declared inside the PT module class to KeyboardManagerConstants.h
To clean up the projects in VS, Header files, Source files and Resource files filters were added for the projects.
No actual code was changed, functions were just moved around

The above changes are also required for making unit tests for the handlers. (#3112 )

This PR moves the publishing steps done as pre-build events to a separate publish.cmd which is called from the build.cmd script.
Since the paths in the script would depend on which folder it was being called from, a variable was set which would store the path of the powertoys root folder. This can be overrided before calling the publish script.
Note: With this change for making MSIs locally you need to separately run the publish.cmd first on cmd prompt after running the following command (required for msbuild to be accepted as a command)
call ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Enterprise\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat"" -arch=amd64 -host_arch=amd64 -winsdk=10.0.18362.0
I will make a separate PR for making this publish.cmd run automatically while building locally but not on the pipeline, but that need not be pushed as a hotfix into stable since it only affects local MSIs.
I also had to hard code in ""Release"" and ""x64"" since I could not use the $(Configuration) and $(Platform) anymore since those variables wouldn't be set when running it from cmd as compared to a build-event.
