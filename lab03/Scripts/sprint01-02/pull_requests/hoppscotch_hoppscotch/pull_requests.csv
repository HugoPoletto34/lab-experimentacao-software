Features

Add a setup for local e2e tests with cypress.
Deploy, with travis-ci, the last commit at branches named tests-* at surge.sh.
Run tests in this url.
Send from travis a comment with a brief result report of the tests at the commit page. See an example at my fork.


New scripts:

npm run e2e - run tests locally (already running) localhost:3000 (cli mode).
npm run e2e:open- run tests locally to (already running) localhost:3000 in browser mode
npm run dev:e2e - start localhost:3000 and tests (browser mode). This is the default command to tdd.

obs:

The deployment pattern of urls at surge is: http://postwoman-:commithash.surge.sh
I added my surge user data at travis (login and token). It would be better to replace it for @liyasthomas account (to keep things centralized).
The github token env at travis should be able to write comment issues with curl (probably it is already).
I tried to do this routine at Pull Requests but I failed. I think it would be better. But could not find a workaround to pull requests restrictions.",4,11

Notes:

I'm not mounting and testing the docker container. Just testing the dev server (run dev) mounted at the travis-ci.
Though would be a better approach (running on docker) the dev server is the same enviroment that is deploying the front end. So I think this should be enough right now.
Cypress is awesome and we can add fake backend responses to run tests (see  tests/e2e/fixtures/ and tests/e2e/support/commands.js). We should create some fixtures of firebase. Something like this.

Release notes
Sourced from cypress's releases.

3.8.0
Released 12/12/2019
Features:

Chrome can now be run in headless mode by using cypress run --headless --browser chrome. Addresses #832.
Cypress now accepts a --tag argument to be used to identify separate runs. Any tags assigned will be shown on the run in the Cypress Dashboard. Addresses #2561.
The commands .its() and .invoke() now accept an options object to allow changing logging options. Addresses #1450.
Cypress will now attempt to use the unzip binary during cypress install before trying the slower, Node.js-based unzipping method. Addresses #3803.
Upgraded Electron to 7.1.4. This bumps the internal Node version to 12.8.1 and the internal Chromium version to 78.0.3904.113.

Bugfixes:

We fixed a regression in 3.5.0 where Cypress would crash on Windows when trying to pass a url through --config or --env command line flags. Fixes #5466.
We fixed a regression in 3.5.0 where a supplied Cookie header during ""cy.visit() visit or cy.request() would be overwritten by the Cookie header generated from the browser's cookie store. Fixes #5894.
We fixed a regression in 3.5.0  where cy.getCookie() would incorrectly filter cookies by their domain, leading to unexpected results. Fixes #5656.
We fixed a regression in 3.5.0 where calling .type({ force: true }) on hidden inputs would not type the correct characters. Fixes #5835.
We fixed a regression in 3.5.0 where .type() was not respecting previous selections if the current value of the input was the same as the key. This also fixed an where .type() would not respect previous selections in non-selectionRange inputs (like email or number inputs). Fixes #5703.
During visibility checks, Cypress now properly evaluates a DOM element transformed by scale(0) or rotateY(90deg) as not visible. Fixes #723.
Fixed a bug where the specs list in interactive mode would not refresh when files are changed on disk. Fixes #5933.
env configuration option displays properly within the settings panel. Previously, setting env options would incorrectly render ""undefined"" as the value. Fixes #5859.

Misc:

We removed the max viewport size and lowered min viewport size to 0 for cy.viewport() Addresses #5871 and #5892.
The Test Runner now shows a non-Chrome logo for browsers passed in via config.browser that are not of the Chrome family. It also supports showing the Firefox logo (in preparation for Firefox browser support). Fixes #5745.
We updated the look of some of our icons. Addressed in #5822.
We're continuing to make progress in converting our codebase from CoffeeScript to JavaScript. Addresses #2690 in #5643.
cy.request will now automatically encode special characters in the request URL, including Unicode. Addresses #5274.
You can pass additional Electron launch command line arguments using environment variable ELECTRON_EXTRA_LAUNCH_ARGS. Addresses #5807.

Dependency Updates:

Upgraded ansi-escapes from 4.2.1 to 4.3.0. Addressed in #5815.
Upgraded electron-context-menu from 0.11.0 to 0.15.1. Addressed in #5495.

Main Feature
With this feature, OAuth 2.0 access token can be retrieved directly from inside Postwoman.
Since Postwoman is a web-based SPA, it have no way to hide client secret used in the normal OAuth 2.0 flows. Therefore, only Authorization Code Flow + PKCE is implemented.
Additional Features

 Automatic configuration using OpenID Connect Discovery endpoint ( Configure endpoints automatically! )
 Access Tokens Management ( Save, reuse, and delete multiple access tokens )
 Token Request Management ( Save, reuse and delete multiple authorization endpoints configuration )

Limitations

Users can only use OAuth Service Providers that provide PKCE support for client authentication.
Users have to register Postwoman as callback URL and trusted/allowed origin (CORS) in the OAuth application and Service Providers' settings.

There should be room for improvements but for the time being, I think the core functions here should works ( tested with Okta and Auth0 as Service Providers ). Feel free to suggest and improve üë®‚Äçüíª üë©‚Äçüíª üöÄ

It ports every code file (except tests and pages/index.vue) to TypeScript with as much types provided.
There are certain things to note about the TypeScript addition to the project though.
Some Important Changes
There is a change in the way components are imported.
Components before could be imported with this snippet
import Section from ""../components/section"";
But from this PR on, it will be:
import Section from ""../components/section.vue"";
For Vue components, you have to include the file extension.
Default Vue component code is modified a bit
Vue component scripts are used to be written as
<script>
export default {
...[[ Component Code ]]...
};
</script>
From this PR onwards it will be
<script lang=""ts"">
import Vue from ""vue"";

export default Vue.extend({
...[[ Component Code ]]...
});
</script>
NOTE : It is also best to include an empty component script even if the component has no code logic, sometimes the compiler doesn't pick up the Vue component otherwise
Directives and Middlewares have a new code format
The way directives and middlewares are written have been revamped to work with TypeScript, please check the code in the corresponding folders, to see how it is written in the new format
Some notes on the TypeScript and Vue interaction


I noticed while porting that TypeScript compiler will freak out if it can't resolve/infer types from the component code, so if you find TypeScript giving you weird errors like (foo is not a property of this), try explicitly specifying types, that will usually resolve that sorta issues.


While adding plugins, make sure to import them into vue-plugins.d.ts file and add it to the import declaration, sometimes, it will be automatically be picked up (its a bit finicky), if you still can't access the plugin, just add the plugin reference to the Vue interface present in the same file.


Now, this PR doesn't bring full TypeScript port, pages/index.vue is due a huge refactor and it will be rewritten in TypeScript during that process. Also, tests will still be written in JavaScript.
Also, another thing to note is that, I haven't fully brought types as much as possible, some places could use more typings (and less any), particularly the types regarding the store are implemented with any as a placeholder. This needs to be refactored into more meaningful type definitions in the future.
Soooo, that's about it,
Happy hacking üòÑ

Network Strategies are basically functions which take in the Postwoman Store and the request config and returns a Promise for the response. It generalizes the network request making process and makes further introduction of features easier.
Currently, this PR introduces 2 Network Strategies

AxiosStrategy : Uses axios to send the request
ProxyStrategy : Uses the postwoman proxy feature to send the request through a proxy.

Currently, Network Strategies allow its consumers to not worry about whether proxy is enabled, the sendNetworkRequest (found in functions/network.js) function will detect the appropriate strategy from the available and executes that. But in the future, when we plan to add new strategies (for e.g for native), we do not need to worry about rewriting the consumers to adopt those.",4,8

This adds a new NetworkStrategy to hook with the Firefox Content Script to run the query.
NOTE
Do NOT use the extension from the store to test the strategy, because, the extension is configured to only hook into the postwoman.io and postwoman.netlify.com domains. Other domains won't get hooked and hence won't get access to the extension hooks.
So, to test this PR, you have to clone the postwoman-firefox repo.
Then head into the manifest.json file and edit it to match this snippet below
 ""content_scripts"": [
    {
      ""matches"": [
        ""*://*/*"",
        ""https://postwoman.io/"",
        ""https://postwoman.io/*"",
        ""https://postwoman.netlify.com/*"",
        ""https://postwoman.netlify.com/""
      ],
      ""js"": [ ""index.js"" ]
    }
  ],

Then run npm install and then npm run build.
NOTE: npm run build may fail on non-Unix compliant systems as it uses the cp command, if it fails, just copy the icons folder and the manifest.json to the dist folder
This will create a folder called dist with the generated code.
Then, open Firefox and navigate to about:debugging, select This Firefox and the click on Load Temporary Add-on... and then select the manifest.json file in the generated dist folder.
After this you can navigate to the Postwoman app in localhost and access it, you can check if the hook was successful or not by opening the console on the Postwoman app and checking for the log ""Connected to the Postwoman Firefox Extension!"" after load.
Once that is done, just fire a request anywhere and you will see that CORS restrictions won't be applied.",3,3

This adds a new NetworkStrategy to hook with the Chrome Content Script and Background Script to run the query.
NOTE
Do NOT use the extension from the store to test the strategy, because, the extension is configured to only hook into the postwoman.io and postwoman.netlify.com domains. Other domains won't get hooked and hence won't get access to the extension hooks.
So, to test this PR, you have to clone the postwoman-chrome repo.
Then head into the manifest.json file and edit it to match this snippet below
  ""content_scripts"": [
    {
      ""matches"": [
        ""https://postwoman.io/"",
        ""https://postwoman.io/*"",
        ""https://postwoman.netlify.com/*"",
        ""https://postwoman.netlify.com/""
      ],
      ""js"": [ ""contentScript.js"" ]
    }
  ],

Then run npm install and then npm run build.
This will create a folder called dist with the generated code.
Then, open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions, click on Load Unpacked and then select the generated dist folder.
Next, go to your postwoman cloned repo and open the file functions/strategies/ChromeStrategy.js and edit EXTENSION_ID constant to match with the extension ID you got while loading our Unpacked Extension in the prior step (to find it, just click on the extension details of our extension).
The defined EXTENSION_ID is for the extension in the Chrome Web Store.
After this you can navigate to the Postwoman app in localhost and access it, you can check if the hook was successful or not by opening the console on the Postwoman app and checking for the console log ""Connected to the Postwoman Chrome Extension!"" after load.
Once that is done, just fire a request anywhere and you will see that CORS restrictions won't be applied.
NOTE: The Chrome extension isn't marked public yet in the Chrome Web Store, it will be marked public as soon as this PR is approved",4,17

In this scenario, husky runs yarn prettier to format all of the files within the repo before being staged. This is done in the .huskyrc file like so (this can be moved to the package.json file if we want):
{
  ""hooks"": {
    ""pre-commit"": ""npm run prettier""
  }
}

I've used an opinionated Prettier config .prettierrc which look's like the following (this can be moved to the package.json file if we want):
{
  ""trailingComma"": ""es5"",
  ""semi"": false,
  ""singleQuote"": true,
  ""printWidth"": 100
}

The command that is added to the package.json is the following:
""prettier"": ""prettier --write **/*.{html,js,json,vue}""
This tells Prettier what files can be formatted.
The reason for this PR is to clean up the code quality and formatting within the repo, to one that's consistent (updated by Prettier).
Note: This does not affect how new code must be written or formatted. You can code/format in any way you would like, and Prettier will format it right before changes are committed to the repo/PR is made.",5,25

Release notes
Sourced from cypress's releases.

4.1.0
Released 2/28/2020
Features:

There is a new cypress info command to see the locally detected browsers and other information related to Cypress. Addresses #4540.
You can now click a 'Try Again' button to recheck if the server at the designated baseUrl is running within the warning message during cypress open. Addresses #3284.
There are ""collapse all"" and ""expand all"" links in the Test Runner's ""Tests"" tab to collapse or expand all folders within the ""Integration Tests"". Addresses #6282.
The plugins file function's config argument now includes projectRoot (absolute path to the root of the project) and configFile (absolute path to the configuration file). Addresses #5941.

Bugfixes:

Fixed a regression where Cypress could throw a ""Maximum call stack size exceeded"" error when transmitting a circular object over the internal WebSocket. Fixes #6582.
We fixed an issue where using Chromium-family browsers could cause Cypress to throw a ""WebSocket is not open: readyState 3"" error under certain conditions. Fixes #5685.
We now more thoroughly ensure the parent of an element exists when recursively calling visibility and existence checks in order to prevent some maximum call stack errors. Fixes #4373.
We fixed an issue where a maximum call stack error would throw in some circumstances when xhr.onreadystatechange is accessed. Fixes #5864.
We fixed a regression in 3.5.0 where typing into an iframe with a body element with the contenteditable attribute would throw an error. Fixes #5930.
We now set the default window size when running Chrome headlessly to 1280x720. Fixes #6210.
We fixed an issue where cypress install would not complete on Node.js 8.0.0. Fixes #6512 and #6568.
{% url ""cy.clearLocalStorage()"" clearlocalstorage now properly accepts the log option to disable logging. Fixes #6342.

Misc:

The error messages displayed when rerouting to a non same-origin domain has been updated to more accurately reflect the rules around same-origin policy. Addresses #6048.
We fixed an error message that would display the wrong available browser families during validation. Addressed in #6517.
We fixed some typos in some of our error messages. Addressed in #6508.
We're collecting more environment variables when running Cypress with GitLab CI. Addresses #6231.
The typing of cy.$$ has been updated to distinguish differences between it and Cypress.$. ""More info here"" $#Cypress-vs-cy Addresses #2027.
We're continuing to make progress in converting our codebase from CoffeeScript to JavaScript. Addresses #2690 in #6552, #6523, and #6545.

Dependency Updates

Upgraded electron from 7.1.10 to 7.1.13. Addressed in #6566.

As I've commented on commit b14adc2, the problem with JSON body and raw input is happening again after this commit, maybe I've named things badly (canListParameters) and you misunderstood me, so I'm suggesting another fix üòõ
I've realized that it's getting rawInput original state from Vuex, and then it could happen to have JSON content with raw input disabled and without the toggle component, this way it would not be possible to enable raw input at all...
Now I'm making sure rawInput is true always canListParameters is false, and kept (revert) canListParameters to be true only with application/x-www-form-urlencoded.

Release notes
Sourced from cypress's releases.

4.4.1
Released 4/20/2020
Bugfixes:

Cypress can now launch on systems where Chromium is installed via Snapcraft. Fixes #7020.
We now check whether the mouseup event's target element is detached before issuing the click event during .click(). Fixes #6923.
We fixed a regression in 3.8.1 where the Test Runner could send an undefined organization ID during project setup when the default organization is preselected. Fixes #7013.
We fixed a regression in 4.4.0 that caused projects to include bundled TypeScript. Fixes #7036.
Fixed an issue where sites that set Feature-Policy: document-domain 'none' headers would fail to load in Cypress. Fixes #6480.

Misc:

We fixed some extra spacing displaying below the project nav in the Test Runner. Addresses #7023
The typings for run results when using the Module API now indicate they can be null or undefined. Addresses #6126.
We're continuing to make progress in converting our codebase from CoffeeScript to JavaScript. Addresses #2690 in #7004.

Editor integration: Use resolve if builtin require.resolve is overridden (#8072 by @fisker)
This fixes issues that the users of Atom and WebStorm faced with 2.0.4.
Prettier now switches to using the resolve module for resolving configuration files and plugins if it detects that require.resolve isn't Node's builtin function (doesn't support the second argument), which happens in environments like editor extensions. To force the fallback, set the PRETTIER_FALLBACK_RESOLVE environment variable to true.

Release notes
Sourced from cypress's releases.

4.6.0
Released 5/20/2020
Features:

Errors in the Test Runner now display a code frame to preview where the failure occurred with the relevant file, line number, and column number highlighted. Clicking on the file link will open the file in your preferred file opener and highlight the line and column in editors that support it. Addresses #3762.
Cypress now utilizes source maps to enhance the error experience. Stack traces are translated so that your source files are shown instead of the generated file that is loaded by the browser. Cypress will include an inline source map in your spec file. If you modify the preprocessor, ensure that inline source maps are enabled to get the same experience. Users of @cypress/webpack-preprocessor should upgrade to v5.4.1 or later of the package which will correctly inline source maps. Addresses #881, #1761 and #3966.
Cypress now enables AST-based JS/HTML rewriting when setting the experimentalSourceRewriting configuration option to true. Addresses #5273.
Number arguments passed to have.text, have.id, have.data, have.value, and have.attr assertions chainers are now automatically cast to strings for comparison. Addresses #7314.

Bugfixes:

Default TypeScript options are now set to module: commonJS which Node.js and the browser expect. This fixes a situation where setting a different module in a tsconfig.json would cause errors to throw if you had export, import or async keywords in your code. Fixes #7005, #7011, #7043, and #7151.
When experimentalSourceRewriting is enabled, setting location or location.href to a relative href, or using location.replace or location.assign with a relative href will no longer navigate the AUT to the wrong URL. Fixes #3975 and #3994.
When experimentalSourceRewriting is enabled, the use of window.top and window.parent will no longer cause the AUT to break out of the Cypress iframe. Fixes #5271 and #1467.
When experimentalSourceRewriting is enabled, calls to window.frames, window.parent.frames, and other frames will no longer point to the wrong reference after being proxied through Cypress. Fixes #2664.
When experimentalSourceRewriting is enabled, scripts using the integrity attribute for sub-resource integrity (SRI) will now load after being proxied through Cypress. Fixes #2393.
When experimentalSourceRewriting is enabled, the use of document.location to set the URL will no longer navigate the AUT to the wrong URL. Fixes #7402.
Type definitions will no longer conflict when running Cypress in a project with Jest. Fixes #3536.
We increased the timeout for launching Firefox from 2.5 seconds to 50 seconds. Previously, users hitting this limit would encounter a ""cannot open socket"" error; now, the error will be wrapped. Fixes #7159.
.click will now click in the correct coordinates when either x or y coordinate options are zero. Fixes #7319.
Cypress no longer displays onError is not a function when a browser can't connect. Fixes #7217.
You can now pass the force: true option to .select() to select options within a disabled <select>. Addresses #107.
We now throw an error when attempting to .select() an <option> within a disabled <optgroup>. Fixes #7226.
We fixed a regression in 4.3.0 where the message output during errors were not formatted correctly. Fixes #6924.
Using Cypress._.capitalize now correctly behaves the same as Lodash's capitalize method. Fixes #7222.
When experimentalComponentTesting is enabled, clicking on a component spec now watches the correct file without assuming it is an integration file. Fixes #7244.
Firefox video recording no longer crashes Cypress when running very short spec files. Fixes #6408.
Applications containing a DOM element with an id attribute containing 'jquery' will no longer throw an error during cy.visit(). Fixes #6193.
Long errors generated when compiling or bundling the test file are now horizontally scrollable. Fixes #6898.

Misc:

Cypress no longer requires write access to the root of the project, it instead will display a warning when no write access is given. Addresses #1281.
We increased the timeout for launching Chrome from 20 seconds to 50 seconds. Addressed in #7372.
We increased the timeout for macOS or Linux to exit from a --version command when looking for available browsers from 5 seconds to 30 seconds. Addressed in #7366.
We improved error handling when Cypress launches Chromium-family browsers. Addresses #6518.
We now export Cypress.ConfigOptions types as a partial of the full options interface. Addresses #7238.
We're continuing to make progress in converting our codebase from CoffeeScript to JavaScript. Addresses #2690 in #7162, #7216, #7227, #7320, #7232, and #7345.

Dependency Updates:

Upgraded @cypress/browserify-preprocessor from 2.2.2 to 2.2.3. Addressed in #7291.
Upgraded cookie-parser from 1.4.4 to 1.4.5. Addressed in #7389.
Upgraded cypress-multi-reporters from 1.2.4 to 1.4.0. Addressed in #7431.

The first major update is the switch to binary responses for data. The current response system expects only string responses and acts really funky for binary responses. The new response system expects data to be stored in pure ArrayBuffer objects. The implementation for this is ongoing and the dependent like the Browser Extensions and Proxywoman are expected to be updated to comply with the system.
The second major update deals with a change in how we present responses. Certain responses, especially those with binary content expect a special way to render contents the current implementation for specializing for different types of contents are not really extensible to allow support for these varied and completely different response types. Hence, a concept of a Response Lens is being introduced, it is simply an extensible mechanism to give certain Content Types to specify a special way to render and allow multiple ways of representation for the same data. The Lens system expects the response data to be represented in the new response system.
This PR intends to fix #929.

Release notes
Sourced from cypress's releases.

4.9.0
Released 6/23/2020
Features:

An animated progress bar now displays on every command in the Command Log indicating how long the command has left to run before reaching its command timeout. Addresses #7642.
There is now an experimentalFetchPolyfill configuration option. When this option is true, Cypress will automatically replace window.fetch with a polyfill that Cypress can spy on and stub. Addresses #7710.
You can now pass a --quiet flag to cypress run to silence any Cypress specific output from stdout. Addresses #7714.

Bugfixes:

cy.wait() now correctly resolves when waiting for XHR requests that contain resource-like text in the XHR's query params or hash (like .js, .html, .css). #7280.
We fixed a regression in 4.6.0 where errors thrown from the application under test as strings would not be correctly handled. Fixes #7590.
We fixed a regression in 4.8.0 where .click() would hang if the subject had a shadow root and experimentalShadowDomSupport was not enabled. Fixes #7679.
We fixed a regression in 4.6.0 so that .should('have.value') now properly asserts against <progress>, <meter> or <li> element's values. Fixes #7603.
Cypress no longer responds with 413 responses during a recorded cypress run when the stdout is too large. Fixes #7548.
We fixed an issue where Cypress could exit successfully even with failing tests when launched in global mode. Fixes #7755.
Assertion logs now properly display as parent commands in the Command Log regardless of what is in the beforeEach hook. Fixes #7731.
When experimentalShadowDomSupport is enabled, querying shadow dom in certain situations will no longer cause the error Cannot read property 'length' of undefined during cypress run. Fixes #7676.
Highlighting of elements upon hover of a command in the Command Log are now visible when targeting absolute positioned elements. Fixes #7762.
cypress run will no longer crash when provided an empty string to the --project flag. Fixes #7743.

Misc:

There is now a loading state to indicated when tests are loading in the Command Log. Addresses #7700.
The type definitions for fixturesFolder, pluginsFile, screenshotsFolders and videoCompression have been updated to allow false TypeScript types. Addresses #7654.
The type definitions for cy.wait(ms) now correctly yield the type of the previous subject. Addresses #7682.
The type definitions now allow for the 'key' keyword when chaining off 'any' or 'all' assertion chainers. Addresses #7665.

Dependency Updates:

Upgraded arch from 2.1.1 to 2.1.2. Addressed in #7672.
Upgraded eventemitter2 from 4.1.2 to 6.4.2. Addressed in #7705 and #7707.
Upgraded getos from 3.1.1 to 3.2.1. Addressed in #7685.
Upgraded is-installed-globally from 0.1.0 to 0.3.2. Addressed in #7703.

Upgraded moment from 2.24.0 to 2.26.0. Addressed in #7718.

When experimentalShadowDomSupport is enabled, using .type() on an input in the Shadow DOM will not result in an error. Fixes #7741.
When experimentalShadowDomSupport is enabled, checking for visibility on a shadow dom host element will no longer hang if the host element was the foremost element and had an ancestor with fixed position. Fixes #7893.
Debug logs from the @benmalka/foxdriver module will no longer appear if any DEBUG environment variable was set. Fixed #7723.

Misc:

We made some minor UI updates to the Test Runner. Addresses #7732 and #7803.

Dependency Updates:

Upgraded recast from 0.18.8 to 0.19.1. Addressed in #7898.

With current implementation, we only have basic syntax linting powered by Esprima.
The new proposed implementation hopes to bring the following changes:

Retire Esprima for syntax linting and implement a more powerful type checking linter with the help of Tern.
Bring code completion (powered with typings) to the editors.
Restrict usage of browser APIs as a security measure (console object is proposed to be still accessible still though)

Progress

 Tern Autocompletion implementation
 Type Docs for both the script types
 Type checking linter and retire Esprima (we are gonna keep esprima around for now)
 Restricting usage of browser APIs (delayed, will be transitioned slowly over time)

Currently, the XML and JSON lenses only support a list of hardcoded media types, but they are able to render any format having the registered +xml and +json media suffixes.
For instance, JSON-LD (application/ld+json) and ActivityPub (application/activity+json) responses aren't rendered by the lens while there are perfectly suitable, and having the JSON preview helps a lot.
This PR uses a regex to detect JSON and XML based media types.
Example with API Platform, which uses JSON-LD by default:
