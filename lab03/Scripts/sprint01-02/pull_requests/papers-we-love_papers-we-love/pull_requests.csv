Papers are like poems. Some are dazzling, some are pedestrian, some are insightful, and some reward long periods of quiet contemplation. They stir up an emotional reaction that goes beyond the strictly rational, and can often be deeply personal.
In graduate school, during a period of identity crisis, I came across Matthias Felleisen's ‚ÄúOn the Expressive Power of Programming Languages‚Äù. At a time when the world was ruled by C++, I had immersed myself in Scheme, so I always looked skeptically at mainstream linguistic claims. However, the language wars seemed beyond rational discourse. So the idea that someone could take a concept as nebulous as ‚Äúexpressiveness&rdquo and formalize it was already a revelation. But the beauty of this paper goes well beyond that: it also lies in the cleanliness of the approach, the correspondence of the formalism to intuition, and the tautness of its execution.
It was the most stunning paper I had ever read, and remains so. It's like the poem that never leaves your soul.

I'm a PhD student at Lancaster University and I research and work on unikernels.  After finding papers-we-love and seeing unikernels subdirectory, I was quick to fork and add some of my favourite papers that I've read on unikernels.  In this commit, I introduce 53 links to pdfs in the public domain or, at the very least, links to the publisher's public citation page of the peer reviewed paper.
The papers have been organised in chronology following the influence of unikernels, particularly focusing on papers which identify traits in increasing application security, portability and performance with respect to its runtime.  This follows from the early definitions, such as microkernels which attempt to increase application portability by only facilitating reliable Inter-Process Communication (IPC).  Second-wave follows the centralizastion of commodity hardware into 'the cloud' and the realization of increasing application performance with networked, mult-core, many user systems.
In the unikernels section, I start with links to a number of papers which describe the concept of unikernels and the need for increasing performance in the cloud and how well tuned Virtual Machines (VMs) can aid in increasing performance.  Following this section is a link to relevant published articles of a number of unikernel/libOS implementations. There are a number of links to articles which compare the performance of unikernels themselves to similar counterparts including monolithic OSes and containers. Finally, unikernels have been used in a number of interesting scenarios, and the applications of unikernels section has links to papers which implement the unikernel model in various scenarios following the claims of their performance and security benefits.",3,4
