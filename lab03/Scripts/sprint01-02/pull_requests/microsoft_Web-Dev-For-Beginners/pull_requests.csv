Removed the word ""physical"" from ""screen reader""
Updated the wording about browser text reading tools
The reason for this is because the functionality and usage of tools like Edge's speak aloud feature and other text reading extensions are fundamentally different from screen readers. They are not primarily used for vision-related disabilities, and provide a very different UX and have different accessibility considerations than screen readers do. Since people who are new to accessibility sometimes confuse simpler text-reading tools for screen readers, I wanted to make the difference more clear in the tutorial wording.
Added a section on zoom
I thought zoom would fit really well in the tools section, since it's easy for anyone to try, and has wide accessibility benefits if done well. I also thought it would be a good place to include easy built-in browser accessibility tools, since all major browsers have some zoom and text sizing options built-in.
Removed the text highlight section
While some people will recommend using <strong> and <em> tags for emphasis because those tags have semantic meaning, it doesn't make a difference to screen reader users in practice, or to any other AT. It seems like a fine recommendation for developers learning HTML in general, bug I couldn't think of a way to relate it to accessibility, and I don't think it would be a good idea to imply that it makes a difference for screen reader accessibility.
Added heading hierarchy section
This was partly to make up for removing the section on text highlight, I wanted to add an alternative advice section on a type of semantic emphasis that makes a big difference to screen reader users.
Switched ARIA example from progressbar to tree
There is actually a semantic HTML element for progressbar, <progress>, so I updated the example to role=""tree""
Some minor wording changes, e.g. to make the distinction between a user and their assistive tech more clear

Thanks for your time, and please let me know if any of the changes aren't well explained or need to be updated!",3,5

Updates to wording (including some random spelling fixes I came across while reading)
Updates to the HTML of the examples and solutions

The wording changes mostly fall into the following categories:

Updates that are necessary due to changing the HTML
Wording choices that (based on my own understanding) are likely to go over better with the disabled community
Updates to instructions that reference screenshots to ensure they don't rely only on visual things like color/iconography/shape

The code changes mostly revolve around labeling form controls and the judicious use of semantic elements.
Please let me know if you have any questions/comments on any specific changes! I also know that I am far from the best wordsmith, so I welcome any suggestions for better phrasing of anything I've added :).

I'm curious what you think! I wasn't sure if this would need to be paired with some more content in the last lesson or not, or if you'd be interested in other more thorough accessibility-related updates. This change only handles keyboard a11y, it's still pretty much unusable with a screen reader, voice control, pointer-only devices like eye control, etc. Some other options include showing arrow key buttons under the title when a plant is activated, or being able to double-click to ""lift"" a plant, then allowing the user to click anywhere else on the page to place it.",3,4
