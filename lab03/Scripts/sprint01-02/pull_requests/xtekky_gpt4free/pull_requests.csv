This PR introduces Docker support to simplify the setup and usage of the gpt4free project, making it more accessible to developers and ensuring a consistent environment.
Changes:

Added Dockerfile to define the container environment.
Added docker-compose.yml for easy setup and orchestration.
Updated README.md with instructions on how to use Docker to set up and run the project.

How to Test:

Ensure Docker and docker-compose are installed.
Clone this branch.
Run docker-compose up from the project root.
The application should be accessible at http://localhost:1337.

Please review and provide feedback. If there are any issues or improvements needed, I'm open to making the necessary changes. Thank you for considering this contribution!",4,5
