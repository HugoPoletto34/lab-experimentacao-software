Changes

Changed demo link from Standard File documentation to the universal web app.
Changed source code link to the organization, because SN has a whole app stack ranging from web/android/ios clients on top of a server.
The main server component of SN is in Ruby, not Ruby/Node (there is an unofficial Node implementation).

simply read that it was ""built with popular open source technologies,""

good option. A better description would call out a feature or offer a
reason distinct from other items in the same category. I think Emby's
out-of-the-box support for both DLNA and DIAL is worth noting and helps
the reader understand what and why Emby actually is more quickly.
