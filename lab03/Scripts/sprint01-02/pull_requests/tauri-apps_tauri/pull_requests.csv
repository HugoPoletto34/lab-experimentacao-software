There's an edge case for how the webview and our embeddedServer loads its URLs.
When the config -> host is set to something like localhost or 127.0.0.1 (without http:// protocol), the server starts correctly, but the webview doesn't. We have to explicitely set the http protocol on the webview, but not on the embedded web server.
So, with this PR, we add the protocol for the webview load URL if its not there, and we always remove it from the config host. With this approach, the embedded web server MUST be served locally.

This is following up on the discussion in #48. This PR currently builds anything with a cargo.toml as a minimal / first step check. Future steps may include building and testing against the smoke tests. Many of the builds currently fail though so not sure how we want to proceed with that. It may very well be my misunderstanding, but opening this to begin the discussion.

Reqwest contains the Tokio runtime which is extremely bloated.  At this given moment we do not use updater or the http libraries for anything.  I decided to take them out for now by adding a feature flag and making the associated dependencies optional.  Compile time is a bit faster now though someone needs to test this with an actual project to make sure nothing was inadvertently broken.",3,0

There are a few dependencies and modules that are not necessary at the current moment. Some are even redundant (see the platform and version modules for more details).  The objective of this PR is to thin them out using cfg and feature flags.
Also, due to the amount of environment variables required to compile the core library, a development environment pipeline needs to be established using a test project.  This can be done via default feature flags and CFG by way of replacing these mandatory environment variables with paths and values from a test project which will work only during development.",3,7

The differentiation of the crates forces the generated code to call from a different crate and to import a second crate rather then just tauri.  Also the environmental variables will need to be adjusted to account for the change in path.

This is the first look at a CODEOWNERS file. I have made preliminary (sub-)teams based on the discussion in discord and documentation files. This file then maps each of those teams to automatically be assigned for review if certain files / folders are edited in a PR. We will need to assign people to each of these groups, but then the leg work for getting reviews should be much smaller. These teams can also be used to @ mention the whole team: @tauri-apps/admins.
I am flexible with team names / grouping, but this should get us pretty far into the discussion at the very least.

Fixes #231
Fixes #202 (already closed)
This should fix the issues where CI builds pass when they should actually fail (see above issues for context).
I was originally looking at the JS/TS side and wondered if process.exit() was causing processes to exit with 0, but when I tried changing that the error was still not solved. After digging through the Rust side I came across these areas:

           bail!( 
        

        
          
             ""Result of `cargo build` operation was unsuccessful: {}"", 
        

        
          
             status

           bundle::print_error(&error).unwrap(); 
        
    
  


It turns out that bundle::print_error was actually swallowing the errors:

PR to add the bare minimum of property test coverage to tauri-api.
In this PR, I defined a set of development scripts to automate setting up the environment variables needed to work on tauri core.  Scripts are provided for Batch, Powershell and Bash.
Quickcheck was then added to tauri-api.  The main concept here is to create simple tests which cover the utility functions in tauri-api.  Prop testing via quickcheck will be more difficult with the webview struct object in the Tauri core library but it is suitable for some of the tests in tauri-api.  A bash script was also provided which allows the Quickcheck tests to run in a loop and test a wide variety of input values.  Some Refactors were also made in this PR.
More tests will be provided in a followup PR for Tauri and Tauri core.",2,0

The code in the runner.rs file is not very idiomatic by rust standards.  It also isn't very testable.  By breaking the code into smaller functions, we can now setup test harnesses to test each for a response rather.  In other words, we are able to test each piece of code independent of the others.
Also added a specific Tauri Result Type.  Will likely add a library like simple-error or error-chain to make the error story a bit better.",2,0

jsdom/jsdom
v16.0.0
Compare Source
For this release we'd like to welcome @​pmdartus to the core team. Among other work, he's driven the heroic effort of constructor prototype and reform in jsdom and its dependencies over the last few months, to allow us to move away from shared constructors and prototypes, and set the groundwork for custom elements support (coming soon!).
Breaking changes:

Node v10 is now the minimum supported version.
The dom.runVMScript() API has been replaced with the more general dom.getInternalVMContext() API.
Each jsdom Window now creates new instances of all the web platform globals. That is, our old shared constructor and prototypes caveat is no longer in play.
Each jsdom Window now exposes all JavaScript-spec-defined globals uniformly. When runScripts is disabled, it exposes them as aliases of the ones from the outer Node.js environment. Whereas when runScripts is enabled, it exposes fresh copies of each global from the new scripting environment. (Previously, a few typed array classes would always be aliased, and with runScripts disabled, the other classes would not be exposed at all.)

Other changes:

Added the AbstractRange, Range, StaticRange, Selection, and window.getSelection() APIs.
Added working constructors for Comment, Text, and DocumentFragment.
Added valueAsDate, valueAsNumber, stepUp() and stepDown() to <input> elements. (kraynel)
Added window.origin.
Removed document.origin.
Fixed <template> to work correctly inside XML documents.
Fixed some bugs which would cause jsdom to choose the wrong character encoding because it was failing to detect <meta charset> or <meta http-equiv=""charset""> elements.
Fixed input.type to default to ""text"". (connormeredith)
Fixed incorrect validation errors for <input> with fractional values for their step="""" attribute. (kontomondo)
Fixed incorrect validation errors on readonly <input> elements.
Fixed <input type=""email"" multiple pattern=""...""> validation.
Fixed fileReader.readAsDataURL() to always base64-encode the result. (ytetsuro)
Fixed inserting <img> elements into documents without a browsing context to no longer crash when the canvas package is installed.
Fixed a memory leak when using window.setTimeout() or window.setInterval().
Improved the performance of getComputedStyle(). (eps1lon)

BREAKING CHANGES

Previously, lint-staged would allow empty commits in the situation where a linter task like ""prettier --write"" reverts all staged changes automatically. Now the default behaviour is to throw an error with a helpful warning message. The --allow empty option can be used to allow empty commits, or allowEmpty: true for the Node.js API.
Node.js v8 is no longer supported because it will reach EOL on 2019-12-31
Prior to version 10, tasks had to manually include git add as the final step. This behavior has been integrated into lint-staged itself in order to prevent race conditions with multiple tasks editing the same files. If lint-staged detects git add in task configurations, it will show a warning in the console. Please remove git add from your configuration after upgrading.

This is the first phase of the publishing pipeline. We can manually kick this process off for now, and once the PRs are merged it will publish the packages for us. If we merge in a PR to dev with ""version updates"" in the commit message, it will open up a PR to master. Once the PR to master is merged, it will publish the packages and create a release announcement.

💬 Common

Temporary fix for #​253.

v3.2.0
Compare Source
💬 Common

An empty pattern now causes an error (#​247)

🚀 Improvements
In the #​156 issue we've redesigned the deep filter, which controls the reading of directories in depth.
Previously, this filter did not use positive patterns directly (only their maximum depth). The example below shows how many extra directories we read:
{src,fixtures}/**

src → read
fixtures → read
out → read
node_modules → read

Now we apply positive patterns.
{src,fixtures}/**

src → read
fixtures → read
out → skip
node_modules → skip

Real world benchmark

{blocks-*,construct}/**/*.styl (a very large project) 13s → 0.16s

Known issues

For some cases, there is a noticeable slowdown of 3-6%.
Patterns containing {a..z} (or similar) may introduce some slowdown.
Actually, fast-glob is 2 times slower than node-glob in this scenario.

We will work on this in the future.
🎉 Thanks

@​jonschlinkert for the scan method in picomatch that returns parts of the pattern.
@​fisker for early beta feedback.

⚠️ In Babel 7.8.0 we introduced the --copy-ignored option for @babel/cli, defaulting to false. However, previous versions behaved as if that option was present: for this reason, we changed its default value to true (when --copy-files is provided) and introduced a --no-copy-ignored option to disable it.

The many rules for Node.js in the ESLint core will be deprecated in ESLint 7.0.0. This release includes the clone of those core rules.
✨ Enhancements

8788a11 added ten rules from the ESLint core:

node/callback-return rule that corresponds to callback-return rule.
node/global-require rule that corresponds to global-require rule.
node/handle-callback-err rule that corresponds to handle-callback-err rule.
node/no-mixed-requires rule that corresponds to no-mixed-requires rule.
node/no-new-require rule that corresponds to no-new-require rule.
node/no-path-concat rule that corresponds to no-path-concat rule, plus this recognizes template literals as well.
node/no-process-env rule that corresponds to no-process-env rule.
node/no-process-exit rule that corresponds to no-process-exit rule.
node/no-restricted-require rule that corresponds to no-restricted-modules rule, but this has simplified options.
node/no-sync rule that corresponds to no-sync rule.


ade0b59 added node/no-restricted-import rule that is ES modules version of node/no-restricted-require rule.

I think I'm ready for the first round of reviews.
To understand how the updater work please refer to the README
This is an early Alpha version allowing us to test if it works. The sequence is not smooth as it should but it should works. It's been tested on mac, windows, and Linux (ubuntu)
Tests with built artifacts
Built on: Thu Mar 23 2021 at 9 AM EDT.
Windows
Download the MSI here -- Once installed launch, it and once you launch the app, you should get asked to update. It should launch a new MSI, follow step, relaunch app you should be updated (no more popup)
Mac
Download the latest app here -- Copy it inside /Applications, launch the app, you should be asked to update, follow step. Restart the app -- You shouldn't be prompted to update.
Linux
Download AppImage from here -- Launch the app, You should be prompted to update. Follow step. Restart should be done automatically. You should be updated to v2
Tests

updater api tests

Known bugs

 mac -- once installed the app close but do not restart (not implemented yet)
 mac -- app need to be added inside /Applications for the updater to work? Probably a packager (manifest) issue
 win -- when MSI is launched, the app do not close (should be spawned)
 win -- wix can't kill the process as it's not spawned so I guess wix is a child of tauri (force kill the process manually of tauri app) fixed it

Todo

 Unit/Smoke tests
 tauri.js (cli) integration for key generation
 Better error handling
 Cleanup
 MacOS tests and fix
 Windows tests and fix
 Linux tests and fix
 If the public key is provided inside tauri.conf.json, when installing an update we need a valid signature
 KeyPair generation [bundler]
 Executable signature for the update [bundler]
 Archive generator (generate tar.gz & zip automatically on release)
 Allow fallback URLs (if one URL failed or is down, we fallback to next update URL)
 FIX: When extracting overwrite existing file only without deleting existing
 Instead of bundling a zip & tar.gz, push AppImage, Wix (Installer) and mac tar.gz of the Application folder)
 Consume the API via Tauri",9,9

This PR implements an action that will run covector version on a merge to the dev branch. After it runs, it will open up (or update an existing) PR with the version changes implemented. To kick off publishing of packages, the PR needs only to be merged which will invoke the next PR to open targeting the master branch and the publishing sequence.

Compare Source

Feature - Support TypeScript out of the box. #​84 #​86 #​95 #​110 #​112
Deprecation - merge.smart has been dropped as it's tricky to support all the corner cases. Instead, it's better to use the provided utilities to put together a merge that fits your case.
Deprecation - mergeStrategy has been dropped in favor of using mergeWithCustomize with customizeArray and customizeObject.
Deprecation - merge.multiple has been dropped as the functionality was too specific and it's better to implement in the user space if needed.
Breaking - merge has been moved as a regular import (i.e. import { merge } from 'webpack-merge').
Breaking - Merge customization has been moved behind mergeWithCustomize.
Breaking - Bump supported Node version to 12
Feature - customizeArray supports wildcards now. Example: 'entry.*': 'prepend'. #​45 #​99
Feature - Throw an error in case a Promise is being merged. It's better to wrap configuration within a Promise and merge inside it. #​81
Fix - Drop lodash in favor of simpler dependencies. #​134
Fix - Make unique merge from right to left to match behavior elsewhere. #​119
Fix - Make sure unique doesn't lose non-unique items to merge. #​125

 A convincing reason for adding this feature (to avoid wasting your time, it's best to open a suggestion issue first and wait for approval before working on it)

Other information:
As discussed in this AppImage bug report, Using appimagetool under Docker (and friends) as an executable won't work because AppImage executes its bundle by FUSE mounting the embedded squashfs file system - and this does not work in a container becase FUSE is a kernel feature that is hard (and likely not a good idea anyway) to access from a container.
As the above discussion recommends, it is actually simple to workaround the problem by manually extracting the AppImage file system to a local directory and running it from there.
This drive-by PR adds a test using lsmod to see if we have fuse supported available in the kernel, and if not - uses the --appimage-extract workaround to run the AppImage tool. I have tested this patch by building tauri-theia under docker.
The lsmod detection is probably not ideal, but I'm not sure what other detection method would work better - I thought using an environment variable to trigger the new behavior, but Docker itself does not provide any such identifying environment variable so discovery by builders might be a problem.
Let me know if this feature is interesting but you want a different implementation and I can see what I can do better.",4,13

 Compressed embedded assets (brotli gzip)
 no-server
 embedded-server
 Pass test suite
 Create additional tests for changed/new code (not really sure what to add for config testing)
 TAURI_INLINED_ASSETS support
 TAURI_CONFIG support
 Refactor AppConfig -> AppContext to prevent repetition.  (i.e. &application.config.config -> &application.ctx.config)
 handle public paths as in webpack instead of iteratively removing parents from assets


This is the replacement for #830.  That PR was more about seeing if it was possible, this PR is about actually removing core environmental build variables from tauri.
This branch/pull request should be tracking changes from dev to prevent having a massive conflict at the end.  This touches a few ""core"" files like runner.rs and has some tentacles in otherwise not related code due to moving tauri-api::config into tauri-config so conflicts are definitely going to happen.
As of the first commit, it can build a no-server application that has been run with tauri dev or tauri build to generate the index.tauri.html.

As a high level overview of additional changes planned in this branch:

All tests need to be updated
Support for embedded-server. (and every existing way of using tauri)
Handle additional env vars like TAURI_CONFIG and TAURI_INLINED_ASSETS which are currently ignored

See comments on #830 for a more specific overview if needed",3,16

Runs clippy + tests on all the crates in the workspace.  Crates with mutually exclusive features (tauri) are run separately, and for each mutually exclusive feature.  This was inspired by having #850 pass CI checks, but actually fail some of the tests due to features not being enabled (tauri/cli in this case).  I didn't even notice this until I typo'd --all-targets as --all-features.
We also may want to look at doing something similar in CI because some other features besides cli might be slipping through the cracks",2,4

This is a very nice improvement to the cargo-check script helpers.

The cargo commands ran now run identically to how they run in CI
The PowerShell script now exits early on error
Default commands ran now includes a fmt check
Able to pass in sub-commands you want ran as arguments to the script.  e.g. cargo-check.sh fmt clippy to run only run the format check and clippy (in that order). This is useful if we decide to use these on the CI so that we can keep jobs separate but still use the same script.

Just running the script without parameters gives you a CI-like experience for the cargo workspace projects. We could use this script directly in CI (if we decide remove the nice actions-rs/clippy action that puts clippy output next to file diffs) to get an exact CI experience (for the cargo workspace projects)",2,0

As per #888, I think the platform build scripts' output is way too verbose. This PR will hide all the output from those scripts so that they match the behavior of pure rust bundlers.
To Do:

 Provide a configuration to show the script's output
 Show output on error (stderr always shows some info text for some reason, even on success)

Rather than fix stderr, I just added a notice about --verbose if the script fails (dmg/appimage only)",2,0

No change file because there hasn't been a release since the last commit that changed this behavior. (e3e2e39)
An alternative solution would to be implement a struct JsStringLiteral with a fmt::Display that escapes all forbidden codepoints detailed in the spec: https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-literals-string-literals
An approach very similar to this was previously used to escape css content injected inside of the webview crate. (the one before webview_official)
Template string literal fix seems to be by far the simplest change to fix it.  All browsers that tauri supports (the webview browsers) have had support for them for the past 3-4+ years.

A recipe consists of:
* Name
* List of NPM dependencies required (dev and production)
* Sub-commands needed
For example, the react recipes run create-react-app to up the UI. Future recipes can do anything, they could pull down a sample UI, clone a repository, download a static HTML file, initialize another environment that compiles to JS/wasm etc.
The devPath and dist folders nomally configured by the init command are overridden by the recipe definition.
Example process for initializing a tauri project with the React + Typescript recipe:

Fix writeBinaryFile in the js api to call the correct function on the rust side. Before, files were sent in base64 encoding, but the save-as-text WriteFile fs command was reused, without any indication that the contents were base64 encoded. So the WriteFile command had no way of checking and decoding when necessary. WriteBinaryFile on the rust side expects a base64 encoded string, then decodes it.",2,5

Internals

refactor hashing to move the responsibility of hashing module exports info and referenced modules from Dependencies to the Module

Hashing in Dependencies can be much cheaper now (could improve performance when many dependencies are used that point to the same module, like many references to React.createElement)
Fixes bugs where Dependencies forgot to hash some details about the referenced module
The new model elimiates the potential of such bugs are Dependencies have less responsibilities now

webpack/webpack-cli
v4.5.0
Compare Source
Notes

now you can use webpack.config.mjs and webpack.config.js with { ""type"": ""module"" } in package.json
you can avoid using the cross-env package:

Before:
{
    ""scripts"": {
        ""build"": ""cross-env NODE_ENV=production webpack --config build/webpack.config.js""
    }
}
Now (you can remove the cross-env if you don't use it somewhere else):
{
    ""scripts"": {
        ""build"": ""webpack --node-env=production --config build/webpack.config.js""
    }
}

the mode option respect the --node-env option if you don't set the mode option explicit using CLI options or in configuration(s), i.e. --node-env production set process.env.NODE_ENV and mode to production

Release Notes

prettier/eslint-config-prettier
v7.2.0
Compare Source

Added: [@​typescript-eslint/object-curly-spacing].
Added: [react/jsx-newline].

v7.1.0
Compare Source

Added: [unicorn/empty-brace-spaces]. Thanks to fisker Cheung (@​fisker)!

v7.0.0
Compare Source


Changed: At least ESLint 7.0.0 is now required.


Changed: [arrow-body-style] and [prefer-arrow-callback] are no longer turned off by default. They only need to be turned off if you use [eslint-plugin-prettier]. If you do, add ""prettier/prettier"" to your ""extends"" array to turn them off again.
{
  ""extends"": [""prettier"", ""prettier/prettier""],
  ""plugins"": [""prettier""],
  ""rules"": {
    ""prettier/prettier"": ""error""
  }
}
Alternatively, update [eslint-plugin-prettier] to version 3.2.0 or later which automatically turns off these two rules in its ""plugin:prettier/recommended"" config.
The CLI helper tool only warns about these rules if you have the ""prettier/prettier"" rule enabled for a file.


Changed: no-tabs is now a validatable rule. If you use it, you should enable allowIndentationTabs so that the rule works regardless of your Prettier config:
{
  ""rules"": {
    ""no-tabs"": [""error"", { ""allowIndentationTabs"": true }]
  }
}


Changed: The CLI helper tool is now called just eslint-config-prettier instead of eslint-config-prettier-check. This is so that npx eslint-config-prettier always works regardless of whether you have already installed eslint-config-prettier or not: If you have, the local installation is used; if you haven’t, npx downloads a temporary copy.


Changed: The CLI helper tool no longer requires you to pipe the output of eslint --print-config to it. Instead, it does that automatically for you via ESLint API:s added in ESLint v7.
Before:
npx eslint --print-config index.js | npx eslint-config-prettier-check

After:
npx eslint-config-prettier index.js



Improved: The npm package is now 75% smaller.

This ticket, like #850, is going to be a scratchpad; this time for changing the build code to not rely on proc-macros and to try and implement the ability to create an AsTauriContext both automatically and manually.
Changed so far:

Deleted tauri-macros.

The ideal goal is to have no proc-macros, so it will start off with none. It may be necessary to split the load between proc-macros and codegen like many other crates (e.g. phf).


New build.rs based builder in tauri::build (incomplete api).

Allows generating an AsTauriContext scoped struct that can be passed to AppBuilder so far.


Examples are moved from tauri/examples/ to examples/ and added to the workspace.

Because build.rs is not run in library crates for binaries, it was impossible to have an [[example]] that was able to use code meant for build.rs at build time. Workspace examples still check type correctness during cargo clippy.



Some notes:
Because a build script cannot be run for cargo test of a library without a completely custom harness, the tests are currently completely broken. The following resolutions will be tried in order:


Change AsTauriContext to require Send + Sync to allow it to be built as a &'static Config during build.rs and around a manually implemented struct such as struct MyContext(Arc<RwLock<MyData>>); to allow building a context during runtime before AppBuilder::build.
Benefits: Allows the user to have completely custom context behavior if they wish which might enable some advanced use-cases while still having a simple automatically implemented context available with a build.rs. It also allows for us to build a context during a test setup without relying on a build script (hard for tests in a lib).


Implement a function based macro to completely replace the current FromTauriContext derive proc-macro.  This macro would have shared architecture with the codegen implementation, and allow the user to decide between using a build.rs and a proc-macro.

Other information:
This PR adds two macros, #[command] and generate_handler![]. Combined, these allow command handling to look like this:
// Definition in main.rs

#[command]
fn reply_string(s: String) -> String {
  s
}
// Or, if the function needs the WebviewManager
#[command(with_manager)]
fn reply_string(manager: tauri::WebviewManager, s: String) -> String {
  println!(""{}"", manager.current_window_label());
  s
}

fn main() {
  tauri::AppBuilder::<Context>::new()
    .invoke_handler(generate_handler![reply_string])
    .build()
    .unwrap()
    .run();
}
// Calling from js
window.__TAURI__
  .invoke({
    cmd: 'reply_string',
    s: 'Hi'
  })
  .then((res) => console.log('Response:', res))
#[command] adds a second function, NAME_wrapper to function with name NAME. This wrapper function accepts the WebviewManager and serde_json::Value as args, and returns a tauri::InvokeResponse. The serde_json::Value should match the names and types of the original function args, ie the JSON for fn original(name: String) would be {""name"": ""some string""}. The wrapper function casts the value to a typed struct that contains all the function args, and passes them to the original function. It also passes the WebviewManager as the first arg if it is a with_webview command. It then converts the response from the original function to a tauri::InvokeResponse, and then returns it.
The generate_handler![] macro takes an array of paths to #[command] functions and returns a closure compatible with invoke_handler. This closure parses the arg string into a tauri::DispatchInstructions, a simple struct with two params: cmd, a string and args, a serde_json::Value. The cmd param is used in a generated match statement that matches it to one of the functions passed to this macro. It then calls that function's wrapper function with the WebviewManager and args, the JSON value that should hold all of that function's arguments. It returns the output from that function back to the webview.
TODO:

 Clean up macro and use less .unwrap()
 Have commands return a Result for better error handling
 Improve error message from arg parse failure
 Add support for functions that take the webview as an arg
 Support for inferring webview arg type We decided to not include this
 Support async functions
 Update JS API to have cleaner syntax
 Update init template to use macros
 Update examples to use macros
 (after merge) Type check the webview arg for with_webview commands
 (after merge) Add support for state/context",3,0
