Just added more informations to the custom tooltip callback argument.
In order to know which data points are matching, I added a new property dataPoints to the tooltip object passed to the custom tooltip.
This property contains an array[CustomTooltipDataPoint] describes as following:
CustomTooltipDataPoint



Name
Type
Description




index
Number
Matching point index.


datasetIndex
Number
Matching dataset index.


xLabel
String
Matching label on X axis.


yLabel
String
Matching label on Y axis.


pointX
Number
X position of matching point.


pointY
Number
Y position of matching point.



I also added a test case covering this new property, and a description inside the documentation under the Advanced External Tooltips section.
Please let me know if anything,

A silent resize occurs during startup and we do not want plugins to do anything here because the chart is not set up. In the demo linked below, the legend will always be present at the start regardless of the size. I think the correct solution is to have the plugin in this case use the beforeInit call to do this setup.
An alternative solution was to block update calls when the resize notification is sent from a silent resize. This still has the possibility that the plugin would try and access uninitialized data objects.
Another alternative solution would be to have the resize plugin notification also send the silent parameter. This forces plugins to handle this case, which is non ideal.
