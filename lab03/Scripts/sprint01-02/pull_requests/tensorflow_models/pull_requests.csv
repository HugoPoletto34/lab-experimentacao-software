it is not easy to re-generate same situation. so, i made 'ud_train' directory


how to generate error

remove following lines in UD/context.pbtxt and run ./train.sh

input {

This prevents us from being able to use tf_gen_op_wrapper_py and import the ops as needed.
I was finally able to get this model working by following the TensorFlow tutorial for adding a new op and instructing the users to compile the ops on their own before running.
Unfortunately, this results in the Python code having to load word2vec_ops.so, which is not ideal and not cross-platform friendly. If you have other ideas for how to solve this, definitely let me know.",8,16

Thus, the network_fn 'escaped' back to the closure (I hope I'm using that term right?) in which it was originally created, ignoring the arg-scope stack created afterwards by the clone. When the first clone called the network_fn, the weights were put on the default device. So for two GPUs (and two clones), the weights would be assigned to first clone / first GPU, and the second clone would have to read the weights from the first clone's memory.
I simply moved the call to create the model's arg_scope from the outer get_network_fn to the inner network_fn. This way, when network_fn gets called, the model's arg_scope is properly nested within the arg_scopes created by the clones.

This is Takeru Miyato, who is author of the paper ""Adversarial Training Methods for Semi-Supervised Text Classification"".
Thank you very much for your time and effort on making this open-sourced code!
I found some mistakes on the code:



  
    
      models/adversarial_text/adversarial_losses.py
    
    
         Line 228
      in
      f98cd28
    
  
  
    

        
          
           loss = tf.identity(tf.reduce_sum(weights * kl) / num_labels, name='kl') 
        
    
  

 I found that the shape of kl is shape (N, 1) and the shape of weights are shape (N). so weights * kl broadcasted to (N, N) shape. The resulting loss is N times as much as the correct loss.


https://github.com/tensorflow/models/compare/master...takerum:reproduction?expand=1#diff-1fbce96d365468a32829d2a35e62435dL137 here the weights is calculated with input.labels , but the weights should be 1.0 on <eos> in input tokens, not label. If using input.labels for calculating weights, the weights are 1.0 on the position previous to the <eos> in inputs.tokens.


I fixed the above points, and also changed some lines which are different from my original implementation.
Now I get 6.1, 6.3 and 7.2 % validation error rate on the committed version, which are the almost same performance as I got before.
Also I get 5.9% test error rate with full training set (training + validation).
Please take a look at my commits and merge to master.",9,23

I personally find lgtm alerts most useful when using PR integration as it allows to check and deal with potential issues before they find their way into master - for instance several of the alerts fixed by this PR were introduced in recent commits (notably 5b9d909 and 3a65897).

Now we need to specify the flag --label_map_path=object_detection/data/pet_label_map.pbtxt, because its default value is data/pet_label_map.pbtxt (see here). This makes sense because the file is in the object_detection directory, and if the script is run from there, the default value will work fine.
But does it make sense to edit the default value to object_detection/data/pet_label_map.pbtxt so that it's cleaner in the tutorials (but then it wouldn't be the relative path from the file itself)?

Some other recommendations to make this more idiomatic:

use argparse not FLAGS, so that flags will use -
What's the purpose of run_experiment? It should work fine on single worker so no flag is necessary
Can GPU number not be detected from the environment? Maybe can be passed as a Tensor using tf.Scaffold?

First, we will be starting an official, supported collection of models in the repo. These models will be implemented with high-level TensorFlow APIs, fast performance, and other best practices that we think newer TensorFlow users should see. The first few models are already available here.


Second, we will be moving all of the current models in the repository to a subfolder called 'research'. This will clean up the repository significantly by cutting down the number of top-level folders.


Moving forward, the TensorFlow team will only support issues/PRs on the official models. For the research models we encourage the individual researchers to support them, but we cannot guarantee support.
Unfortunately, the main pain of this restructure is that all existing links to models within the repo will be broken.

As my understanding, the deps = [ ""//tensorflow"" ] is looking for a directory tensorflow under the slim, which doesn't exist. Remove the deps fixed the issue, as long as the tensorflow is built and available.
Another approach might define the tensorflow library in workspace, by linking it to outside github repo? However, in this way, it could lead to replicated tensorflow modules?
Thank you.",4,5
