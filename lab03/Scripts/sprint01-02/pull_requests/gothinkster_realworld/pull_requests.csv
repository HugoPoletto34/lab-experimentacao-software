I've recently finished a backend impl (#202), but had trouble with the postman test, because SQLite I've used for the project uses 3 more decimals for microseconds, which get lost in the new Date(t).toISOString() conversion and fail the tests, even though it's a valid ISO 8601 date format.
I've adapted the regex from https://stackoverflow.com/a/3143231/3210255.
I also tried to set the regex as a variable in the collection with:
{
  ""variable"": [
    {
      ""name"": ""iso8601"",
      ""value"": ""/^\\d{4,}-[01]\\d-[0-3]\\dT[0-2]\\d:[0-5]\\d:[0-5]\\d\\.\\d+(?:[+-][0-2]\\d:[0-5]\\d|Z)$/"",
      ""type"": ""RegExp""
    }
  ], ...
}
and using it in the tests with:
ps.variables.get('iso8601')
to avoid repetition, but I couldn't get it to work in newman (with latest version 4.1.0), only in postman, so I left it out.",4,1
