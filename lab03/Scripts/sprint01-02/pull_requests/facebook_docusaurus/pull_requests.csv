User feedback indicated that it may be tedious to have to manage this front matter, especially when there are large numbers of docs.
This new script uses a .json file with the sidebar information to write front matter headers into doc files so that users do not have to manually manage front matter for ordering by changing the previous and next fields. This does not change any of how Docusaurus reads front matter and uses that information, and users may still provide all of the information manually without running this script or having the .json file.
An example .json file, which separates sidebars, and uses document categories and ids:
{
  ""docs"": {

A side effect is that code blocks don't automatically get assigned the correct class, so I've had to make use of the langPrefix option to apply the .hljs class to code blocks. Unfortunately this only works properly when a fenced code block specifies a language, otherwise the langPrefix won't be applied and the code block will not have the correct CSS class.
I've worked around this by applying Docusaurus's code block styling to pre code instead of .hljs, which mostly works, but it would have left plain (non-language) fenced code blocks lacking a background color (which was been handled by Highlight.js). I am bringing back the codeColor site config to allow sites to declare the background color, which ideally should match their Highlight theme.
All of this is non-ideal, and perhaps it's best to consider other markdown libraries that may work better with either Highlight.js or Prism.js.

Problem:
Some languages have auto-generation of documentation as HTML snippets. (JS, OCaml, Java, etc. all of this functionality to varying degrees). The ability to co-locate documentation and code is powerful, so I don't want to give up this ability. I'd also like to be able to insert this code into a Docusaurus site and keep the header/footer styles.
Solution:
This PR makes it so that all .html files found in /pages are treated as html snippets and wrapped with the appropriate header/footer. Technically I don't think this would have to be behind a flag since you always have the ability to output raw HTML to /static, but for correctness sake I think the flag is useful. Since wrapPagesHTML adds a head to the snippets passed in it could create malformed HTML is someone isn't paying attention to use.
If this looks good I will add documentation for it! If not, I'd love ideas for ways to implement similar functionality.",3,2

This is to fix #305
The root cause of the problem is using 'en' as default language regardless of translation enabled or not.
However 'en' and no translation are two different cases. The fix has two major parts:

Components. Basically use empty language property as an indication of no translation.
Template generation. Basically handle the case of no translation.
For readability I've created a new file env.js which encapsulate simple translation and versioning logic. So other places can just call env.translation.enabled to check.

I try to keep the changes minimal but sill has to modify quite a few files.

I've tested run server and generate locally.

This change assumes that sites have configured DocSearch to consider the 'current' tag as one matching the latest version of the site. You can see this is the case with React Native's own config.
The logic goes:
If a version is specified via props and it does not match the latest version, we'll use that version with DocSearch.
If a version is specified via props and it matches the latest version, we'll use 'current' instead.
If no version is specified via props, assume 'current'.
Test Plan
On react-native-website repo, after installing a version of Docusaurus with this patch applied:

Check http://localhost:3000/react-native/docs/getting-started.html (AKA 0.53-RC), confirm 'current' tag is used in script block
Check http://localhost:3000/react-native/docs/next/getting-started.html (AKA master), confirm 'next' tag is used in script block
Check http://localhost:3000/react-native/docs/0.52/getting-started.html (AKA 0.52), confirm '0.52' tag is used in script block

Script block above refers to the block where DocSearch is configured at the end of the HTML body, as such:
<script>
  var search = docsearch({
    apiKey: '2c98749b4a1e588efec53b2acec13025',

I found the current style configuration lacking just a bit of love 💅❤️
At the moment it is super easy to bootstrap Docusaurus.
Less straightforward/clean is to do deeper customizations. Eg.: to change a 9px padding value hardcoded in main.css we need to override that value.
It would be nice to give users much more control over the styling of Docusaurus, keeping the 'zero configuration' paradigm intact.
Test Plan
Add/Fix tests TBD

#389
Plan
We start by implementing processing with postcss and precss

PreCSS combines Sass-like syntactical sugar — like variables, conditionals, and iterators — with emerging CSS features — like color functions, logical and custom properties, media query ranges, and image sets.


 Move styles route logic in separate file
 Add postcss + precss + autoprefixer as a basic configuration
 Move color variables (or font variables, or any variable for the css) in a stylesConfig.pcss file
 Split the current main.css file in modules
 Expose more css code to the users
 Many other postcss optimizations (rg. cssnano to compress output)
 Manage magic css values (margin or padding px values etc) in the stylesConfig file
 Give more control over the react component (Default component + extends? )
 Add more to options to configure the react components, eg. transitions, block visibility, block order

Extra: the Docusaurus default mascotte

Some of the Markdown docs are generated and therefore should not be edited. Instead contributors should edit the source data files (e.g. .json or .yaml or otherwise) which are used to generate the final Markdown docs.

Adresses #344.
I separated this into two PRs. This one only adds the function to extract a table of contents out of a markdown document's header tags. The table of content only has two levels at most. By default h2 tags are used for top level headings and h3 for subheadings. This can be customized, and the idea is to allow users to choose the tags to be used as top level and sub headings from siteConfig. More info about that in the other PR.

This function is pretty self-contained and should work from anywhere. Document markdown in => table of contents out.

This is how the table of contents generated from the document's headers can be displayed as a separate sticky sidebar on the right side of the document. I can write the corresponding docs when we finalize on all the ways the navigation can be displayed through the option onPageNav. This is currently using 'separate'. The other possible values could be false for no on-page navigation, or 'inline' to have it show up underneath the current item's link in the existing sidebar similar to #349.
As for the heading tags used to generate the TOC the default is same as this:
onPageNavHeadings: {topLevel: ""h2"", sub: ""h3""}

topLevel and sub can be strings like above or arrays of strings. sub can also be a falsy value or empty array to indicate the user only needs top level headings.
Another example:
onPageNavHeadings: {topLevel: [""h2"", ""h3"", ""h4""], sub: null}

This will collect all h2, h3, and h4 tags as top headings and generate no sub headings.
Test Plan
All css rules are only applied in browsers that support the css sticky position, and larger than 1024px screens. With this option on (onPageNav: 'separate') the menu wrapper becomes wider site-wide. That's the only change that affects all the site. All other css changes only affect doc pages.

I have noticed that the link to go to the ""main"" page in the navigation header (the one in the upper-left corner, with the header icon) was always targeting the page in the default—en—language, even if localization is enabled and another language was selected (e.f. fr).
I think this is something that has been forgotten as I expected the link to take the currently selected language into account.
Have you read the Contributing Guidelines on pull requests?
Yes.
As this is a very small modification, I quickly tried to set up a local working environment to be able to run ""prettier"" and ""Jest tests"", but could not get it working within a 2 mn time box so I admit I skipped those steps.
I made sure the line was still < 80 characters (which was not before I read the Contributing Guidelines) and had the right number of spaces for indentation though.

Maybe an hour.


Will the proposed change cause an increase in product unit cost, such as by increasing third-party product licensing fees?
No.


Will the change affect any marketing, manufacturing, training, or customer support plans?
No.



For #413, this was a server-side fix that allowed pages incorrectly classified as "".../page/index.html"" to try again and render instead as "".../page.html."" Now, all pages that don't include an extension still go through the same endpoint, except if there's failure, then it tries again except without adding the ""/index.html"" part and instead adds "".html"" to the current path.



Do any existing requirements in the baseline conflict with the proposed change?
No.


Do any other pending requirements changes conflict with the proposed change?
No.


What are the business or technical consequences of not making a change?
A user using a web browser trying to access a webpage on this site that doesn't use the .html extension would be redirected to a page that doesn't render anything.


Will the proposed change adversely affect performance requirements or other quality attributes?
No.


Is the proposed change feasible within known technical constraints and current staff skills?
Yes.


Will the proposed change place unacceptable demands on any computer resources required for the development, test, or operating environments?
No, computer resources should stay the same.


Must any tools be acquired to implement and test the change?
Contributors may use the built-in test suite to test the change using command yarn test. They may also go ahead and try accessing pages with and without the .html extension.


How will the proposed change affect the sequence, dependencies, effort, or duration of any tasks currently in the project plan?
No dependencies needed to be changed and no new dependencies need to be added in order to implement this change.


Will prototyping or other use input be required to verify the proposed change?
Yes, a prototype of this webpage can be used to test if extension-less pages work and if pages with the .html extension still work as well.


How much effort that has already been invested in the project will be lost if this change is accepted?
Possibly a few hours.


Will the proposed change cause an increase in product unit cost, such as by increasing third-party product licensing fees?
No.


Will the change affect any marketing, manufacturing, training, or customer support plans?
No.



For #353, this was a server-side feature implementation that automatically changes the port (adds 1 to the port) until an available port is found. Previously, if the default port was not found then the app would simply exit. Also, if an environmental variable for Port is found, then that port shall be used. If that port is also not available, then it will continue attempting to find another open port. Changing the port does not effect the rest of the components significantly. Previously, a used port would exit the entire process making the server unusable until either A) the port was opened by the user or B) the port number was changed in the server code.



Do any existing requirements in the baseline conflict with the proposed change?
No.


Do any other pending requirements changes conflict with the proposed change?
No.


What are the business or technical consequences of not making a change?
Previously, if port 3000 was already in-use, then this app would simply exit and the pages would not render at all.


Will the proposed change adversely affect performance requirements or other quality attributes?
Yes, if the port is changed so that the server then runs, then the performance will be improved since the app's now in a running state.


Is the proposed change feasible within known technical constraints and current staff skills?
Yes.


Will the proposed change place unacceptable demands on any computer resources required for the development, test, or operating environments?
Some (albeit immeasurable) performance decrease may occur for finding the next available port, especially if a large range of ports after 3000 are also already in use. e.g. (3000), (3000 + 1), ..., (3000 + n).

Design Decisions
For #436, I chose to use HTML5 tables to make for a better UX, as stated an issue.
For #413, I chose to also ""gut"" the callback function used for the extension-less endpoint into its own function definition. I also chose to write a new function for when "".../index.html"" gives an error response.
For #353, on top of writing an algorithm for finding a new, available port, I also give the user an option to define their own port by using environmental variables. If an environmental variable does not exist, then I proceed with default port 3000 and run the port checking algorithm each time until an open port is found.",3,5

Change Impact Analysis
For #413, this was a server-side fix that allowed pages incorrectly classified as "".../page/index.html"" to try again and render instead as "".../page.html."" Now, all pages that don't include an extension still go through the same endpoint, except if there's failure, then it tries again except without adding the ""/index.html"" part and instead adds "".html"" to the current path.

Tested by re-running server to confirm page is still rendered properly and that the page is still being correctly served. I then ran 'yarn test' and that passed all test cases.

Change Impact Analysis
For #353, this was a server-side feature implementation that automatically changes the port (adds 1 to the port) until an available port is found. Previously, if the default port was not found then the app would simply exit. Also, if an environmental variable for Port is found, then that port shall be used. If that port is also not available, then it will continue attempting to find another open port. Changing the port does not effect the rest of the components significantly. Previously, a used port would exit the entire process making the server unusable until either A) the port was opened by the user or B) the port number was changed in the server code.
Do any existing requirements in the baseline conflict with the proposed change?
No.
Do any other pending requirements changes conflict with the proposed change?
No.
What are the business or technical consequences of not making a change?
Previously, if port 3000 was already in-use, then this app would simply exit and the pages would not render at all.
Will the proposed change adversely affect performance requirements or other quality attributes?
Yes, if the port is changed so that the server then runs, then the performance will be improved since the app's now in a running state.
Is the proposed change feasible within known technical constraints and current staff skills?
Yes.
Will the proposed change place unacceptable demands on any computer resources required for the development, test, or operating environments?
Some (albeit immeasurable) performance decrease may occur for finding the next available port, especially if a large range of ports after 3000 are also already in use. e.g. (3000), (3000 + 1), ..., (3000 + n).

A lot of code in pages uses javascript data structures like objects and arrays to store the data. Current logic allows to use translations only with <translate>text</translate> tag. Text that is stored in data structures isn't processed by translate plugin and plugin only processes JSX tags. I added logic that processes AST's CallExpression with name translate and adds translations to i18n/en.json the same way as JSXElement translate does.
Also I refactored translate function and added second optional argument description. It's much better to delegate the logic of preparing translation key with a description or nor to translate function and not to overload babel translate plugin by decision-making. Babel translate plugin just reads desc attribute from the translate tag and passes it to the translate function. So, the logic becomes much more straightforward.
If the translate function call is made without passing optional second argument (description) the default value is used (no description given). The same logic works for <translate> tag with/without description.
Usage.
Add the following require statement to the top of the page file (pages/en/index.js):
const translate = require(""../../server/translate.js"").translate;
Use translate function pages/en/index.js
<GridBlock
  align=""center""
  contents={[
    {
      content: translate('My pretty new content'),
      title: translate('Translation with description', 'custom description')
    },
  ]}
  layout=""threeColumn""
/>
Produces i18n/en.json with lines
// ...
  ""pages-strings"": {
    ""My pretty new content|no description given"": ""My pretty new content"",
    ""Translation with description|custom description"": ""Translation with description"",
   // ...
  }

write-translations.js skips translate calls with non-string arguments (not string literals like templates and expressions). The following code will not add keys to i18n/en.json
const str = 'string';

translate(`String`);
translate('string' + 'string');
translate(str);

Generator will output warnings and will suggest to fill strings with hands.

Yes
Test Plan

I can add functional test to build-files.tests.js but I want to ask where to put <translate> tags and translate calls. As I see, website folder is used not only for tests but for a building of docusaurus.io and such insertions will add undesired functionality to boilerplate. Am I right?
string literals without description - translate('my pretty new content') succeeded. It generates

""My pretty new content|no description given"": ""My pretty new content""


string literals with descriptions - translate('my pretty new content', 'custom description') succeeded. It generates

""My pretty new content|custom description"": ""My pretty new content"",


non-string literal as a key - translate(`my pretty new content`) fails. Output:

Skipping ""translate"" call in /path/Docusaurus/website/pages/en/index.js at line 99 when writing to /i18n/en.json. To enable autogeneration you must pass the string you want to translate as a string literal. Expressions and templates are ignored. You can still add desired strings to /i18n/en.json with your hands.

Test Plan
I've wrote some tests, that should be enough on my opinion.
To check the fixes manually you need write the doc file with the following lines:
## foo
### foo
### foo 1
## foo 1
## foo 2
### foo

By rendering on master branch you will get following anchor links:
#foo
#foo
#foo-1
#foo-1
#foo-2
#foo

After this PR applied:
#foo
#foo-1
#foo-1-1
#foo-1-2
#foo-2
#foo-3

The anchor indexes must not change/increment after page refresh.
Repeat the same with <AUTOGENERATED_TABLE_OF_CONTENTS> and third level headings
Things to discuss
Clashing with headings ending with number
chenglou wrote:

Maybe baz-1. for the second one is good enough? No way to guarantee the titles from not clashing, since you might actually have a title called baz 1

I have checked how github renders in such cases. It adds another one suffix, e.g.: baz-1-1.
Alternatively we can add --1 instead of -1. In this case we will never have any clashing, because toSlug() function will never generate a slug with two hyphens.
Should we mimic github's behavior or take an easier approach with double hyphen? (initially in this PR I have implemented github's behavior)
<Header>, that uses toSlug

Fixes #571. Shorten search bar by 10% on mobile since it doesn't really make too big of a visual difference being shorter.
This is just a quick fix and the nav bar CSS could probably be improved. There's no need for a min-device-width in the media query as the search bar should probably be shortenened for devices below the min-device-width as well.
This fix shouldn't affect existing users as shortening the search bar should be a backward-compatible change.

Realized that the CSS of the site was using device-width media queries, which is deprecated. Use of device-width is not encouraged because it uses the hardware width rather than the viewport width.
This Stack Overflow thread explains well why it's a bad idea:

If your resolution is large enough to get you in one break point, but the width of the browser is small enough to get you in another one, you'll end up with an odd combination of both.

In fact, the site is already suffering from this bug, for example, for the mobile web version of the installation page, the ""Edit"" button is shown even though it's not supposed to, going by the media query:
@media only screen and (min-device-width: 360px) and (max-device-width: 735px) {
  a.edit-page-link.button {
    display: none;
  }
}
I replaced all device-width with the width variants and removed redundant min-widths. Having the min-width breakpoint does not make much sense because there are is no CSS written to handle the widths smaller than the ones the CSS currently has.

Don't uppercase heading cells. This is usually unwanted and should not be a default.

Remove some of the unnecessary CSS and selector nesting.

We launched https://developers.home-assistant.io based on Docusaurus yesterday. After trying to add it to Google Search Console I realized that sitemap.xml is not being generated. Digging into the code, I realized that Docusaurus only generates the sitemap if there is at least 1 page and 1 blog post.
I don't see a technical reason to restrict it to sites having at least 1 blog post and 1 page. Sitemap generates just fine without a blog post. I think that this is a bug, but maybe it's a feature and I am missing something.

Test Plan
1. Prepare test docs
Note that we are mixing flat & subdirectory docs hierarchy. This is to prove that this PR is backward compatible & still allow flat docs hierarchy in addition of sub-directories hierarchy
// ......
├── api-commands.md
├── api-doc-markdown.md
├── api-pages.md
├── api-site-config.md
├── projectA
│   ├── docs
│   │   ├── architecture.md
│   │   └── contributors.md
│   └── README.md
└── projectB
    └── guides
        └── install.md

4 directories, 19 files

2. Modify sidebars.json
{
    // ........
    ""API"": [
      ""commands"",
      ""doc-markdown"",
      ""api-pages"",
      ""site-config""
    ],
    ""Project A"": [
      ""projectA/readme"",
      ""projectA/docs/architecture"",
      ""projectA/docs/contributors""
    ],
    ""Project B"": [
      ""projectB/guides/install""
    ]
  }
}
3. Test development
cd website
yarn start

Check that sidebar is correct
http://localhost:3000/docs/en/next/installation.html

Check that docs in subdirectory can be accessed
http://localhost:3000/docs/en/next/projectA/readme.html

Check that next and previous button is working
http://localhost:3000/docs/en/next/projectA/readme.html

Check that docs in subdirectory of subdirectory can be accessed (not just one level deep)
http://localhost:3000/docs/en/next/projectA/docs/contributors.html

4. Test production build with python SimpleHttpServer
cd website
yarn build
cd build/Docusaurus
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000


Doc still works & sidebar is correct
http://localhost:8000/docs/en/next/custom-pages.html



Subdir docs is working & sidebar is correct
http://localhost:8000/docs/en/next/projectA/docs/contributors.html


5. Check generated build files
cd website
yarn build
tree -a -I ""css|CNAME|.circleci|img|js"" build/Docusaurus/docs/ > build.txt

Results are expected
Full generated files structure can be seen at https://gist.github.com/endiliey/a8492aee8e761d079a779f5010219bad

6. Versioned docs test !!
cd website
yarn run version 1.1.6

Make some changes on projectA/readme.md
yarn run version 1.1.7

Look at generated versioned_docs. It works :)

Version 1.1.6 projectA/README

Version 1.1.7 projectA/README

7. Translation test
As docusaurus main website does not have a translation ready, I used my own site to test this feature.
My doc structures:
docs/
├── docusaurus
│   ├── about.md
│   └── introduction.md
├── projectA

When processMetadata function is called in translated_docs, the logic to determine the multilingual language has bug.

I actually wanted something else of the publish script, and was looking into submitting another PR.
Then I found this bug.
In the publish script, shelljs' command output that parses the current branch wasn't unwrapped nor trimmed.
This means that when checking if the deployment branch is the same as the current branch, it would be comparing master to { stdout: 'master\n', stderr: '', ...etc }. Which is false, of course -- so the script would continue and cause #406.

Explanation:
According to https://expressjs.com/en/starter/static-files.html
The function signature is:
express.static(root, [options])
Previous code
  app.use(
    join(siteConfig.baseUrl, 'docs', 'assets'),
    express.static(join(CWD, '..', readMetadata.getDocsPath(), 'assets'))
  );
  app.use(
    join(siteConfig.baseUrl, 'blog', 'assets'),
    express.static(join(CWD, 'blog', 'assets'))
  );
We should not use path.join on Express root argument. Express.js expect something like /docs/assets/ as a root argument. path.join in Unix systems work differently when in Windows work.
Example:
console.log(path.join(siteConfig.baseUrl, 'docs', 'assets'));

In UNIX /docs/assets
In Windows \docs\assets",4,2

It is a vanilla library without dependencies. I put the script to the static/js folder.

Fixes #751
Enable user to set their own description (Inspired from #704)

For Your Information
<meta name=""description"" content="""" /> 
Search engines show the meta description in search results mostly when the searched for phrase is contained in the description. Optimizing the meta description is a very important aspect of on-page SEO
<meta property=""og:description"" content="""" />
This is used for Open Graph description meta. Usually used by crawler of social media like Facebook / Twitter

Previously, all custom pages description will always be tagline because we never pass description props.

Adding custom description for your custom pages is as simple as adding description class property to your React component.
Example:
class Index extends React.Component {
  // ... some code
}
Index.description = 'Endilie is an undergraduate student at Nanyang Technological University (2019). He likes to write & code in his free time';

I removed a lot of Docusaurus base CSS and use styles from GitHub's markdown styles. Also took the chance to remove some unreferenced CSS and cleaned up some implementations. The site should look nicer now (IMO) 😄
Some changes

Improved typography - paddings and margins are more consistent now
Removed unnecessary styling in GridBlock
Footer is now darker shade of black for better contrast
Change background color to #fff
Headers are now black by default (from primaryColor) and have bolder font weight
Blockquotes are changed to yellow (from pink)
Left sidebar is sticky by default on supported browsers

Test Plan for Cross Repo publishing

Have your source docs in one repo (say foo/foo), and point siteConfig.js to another (e.g. set projectName to foo.github.io);
Make sure you're on the master branch;
Run the publish-gh-pages script;
Note how the script doesn't complain about publishing from master and to master. foo.github.io should now have been updated with the latest version of your awesome docs written with Docusaurus;
Make a change, repeat, profit!


Test Plan for same repo publishing

Point siteConfig.js to the repo the docs are going to be hosted on -- e.g. set organizationName to foo and projectName to bar, while your git remote is foo/bar);
Make sure you're on the master branch;
Run the publish-gh-pages script;
Note your gh-pages getting updated with your changes. Watch how foo.github.io/bar gets updated with the latest version of your awesome docs written with Docusaurus.


Test Plan for same repo publishing from wrong branch

Point siteConfig.js to the repo the docs are going to be hosted on -- e.g. set organizationName to foo and projectName to foo.github.io, while your git remote is foo/foo.github.io;
Make sure you're on the master branch;
Run the publish-gh-pages script;
Watch the script deny publishing from master to master.

Current implementation of publish-gh-pages is slightly misleading.
Consider this latest commit on master branch
8d45669

When this got pushed, our circleci run publish-gh-pages and deploy the website at gh-pages branch

If we look carefully, the commit message is
Deploy website version based on 1e6aa2b

And commit 1e6aa2b is actually just the previous commit on gh-pages
This is WRONG, we should display the commit that triggers the publish. Like this
Deploy website version based on 8d45669

This is caused by calling git rev-parse HEAD on the wrong branch.
Before this PR, we try to git checkout gh-pages first

Before:

After fix:

ReasonML
I also did the same on the website of ReasonML, but this time in Chrome. In Chrome it was more difficult to trigger the issue, but sometimes it happened.
Before:

After fix:

Cause
It seems to be caused by the fixed positioning that sometime 'glitches' in the browsers and shows a line of 1px. If you change the top property to 10px for example you see it better.
Fix
Change the value of the top property of the .navigationSlider .slidingNav query to -1px.",5,7

Added unit tests for the functions that were modified and visually verified existing sidebars function the same as well as the new sub categories.

Fix the Jest tests that fail on Windows, and suppress the noise that gets emitted from the 'Build files' test suite.
The problem with the failing tests was path separators separators being hard coded to '/'.
The build-tests emit a load of warnings to do with translation, e.g:
Could not find a string translation in 'es-ES' for string 'About Slash|no description given'. Using English version instead.

These fill up the console and make it difficult to see if the tests are actually passing or not. Given they can just be ignored (they aren't fatal errors, and aren't related to what the tests are checking), I suppressed the console output when the yarn build command is run within the 'Build files' test suite.

This PR appeared during during my work on #868. It contains no new features or logic changes. I've rearranged the code to decouple it from the environment and be able to cover it with tests.
The docs-related logic from server/readMetadata was moved into a separate class DocsMetadata and covered with test.
I've also removed translations.js and replaced it with Translation.t(language, key, category) interface and moved getLanguage implementation from utils to Translation. The Translation class was moved from server/env into a separate file

Yes
Test Plan
The best way is to compare metadata.js before and after my refactoring applied (e.g. with jsondiff.com). They should be the same. The problem is that I can not test with translations applied. I've compared only the metadata.js files I can get locally.
Another one option is to compare current gh-pages version and netlify version using different locales and doc versions.",5,11

After almost 2 years, 4k commits, over 50 pre-releases, and a lot of help we are excited to announce the release of Babel 7. It's been almost [3 years](https://babeljs.io/blog/2015/10/29/6.0.0) since the release of Babel 6! There's a lot of moving parts so please bear with us in the first weeks of release.

<!-- truncate -->

> If you appreciate the work we're doing on Babel, you can sponsor Babel on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/babel), support me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/henryzhu), or get you or your company involved with Babel as part of work. We'd appreciate the collective ownership of this vital project in the JavaScript community!

## It's Happening! 🎉

Software is never going to be perfect but we're ready to ship something that's already been used in production for some time now! [`@babel/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/core) is already at 5.1 mil downloads/month because of its usage in tools like [Next.js 6](https://zeit.co/blog/next6), [vue-cli 3.0](https://medium.com/the-vue-point/vue-cli-3-0-is-here-c42bebe28fbb), [React Native 0.56](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2018/07/04/releasing-react-native-056), and even [Wordpress's frontend](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso) 🙂!

## Babel's Role

I'd like to start this post by re-introducing Babel's [role](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fntd0sPMOtQ) in the JavaScript ecosystem over the last few years.
Header title URL should be correct now.",6,3

First pass at a basic README.md for new websites.
I checked the PRs for documentation websites built with Docusaurus, and it seemed that most PRs were related to adding/editing content, and less about configuring layouts/siteConfig. That's why I added instructions for the popular use cases in the README.md, each with a link to the relevant part of the docs website for further reading.

To improve user experience and low load time for re-visiting users, I would like to include a service worker to make it a Progressive Web App. Adding service worker is easy with scripts in siteConfig but one would require manifest.json to be able to add it to the home screen. With the current code base, there is no extra field to add manifest.json to the head.
Thus have added an optional field manifest in siteConfig and update the lib/core/Head.js along with docs/api-site-config.md accordingly.

Well as the code implies if the config key exists then create the <link /> tag accordingly. No special test cases are required.",5,5

Motivation
All code blocks in the Docusaurus site have ""copy"" buttons on the upper right to let users copy the code to their clipboard. This functionality is also visible in some of the other sites that use Docusaurus such as Babel. However, if you follow the instructions for installation, the resulting site does not have those copy buttons. Moreover, the guide does not mention the copy button at all.
I opened issue #1039 and found that other users would also have preferred a clearer way to add the copy button. I have written a guide on which files need to be added in order to add the copy buttons. I have included it under ""Custom Pages"" since it results in a customization of the resulting site.

Yep.
Test Plan
Create a page with a reference link that is described in #257 and generate a Docusaurus page. The link should be replaced correctly.

Motivation
This PR will improve sidebar to support:

new categories array syntax like in #1026 (but I've changed ids to items)
links to docs from other sidebars
links to other docusaurus non-docs pages
links to external resources
possibility to easily add new sidebar items types with any custom options

Have you read the Contributing Guidelines on pull requests?
Yes
Test Plan
I have added some examples in sidebar.json. It looks like this:
{
  ""docs"": {
    ""Category 1"": [
      {
        ""type"": ""link"",
        ""label"": ""Github"",
        ""href"": ""http://github.com""
      },
      {
        ""type"": ""category"",
        ""label"": ""Subcategory 1"",
        ""items"": [
          ""foo/bar"",
          ""foo/baz""
        ]
      },
      {
        ""type"": ""category"",
        ""label"": ""Subcategory 2"",
        ""items"": [
          {
            ""type"": ""ref"",
            ""id"": ""intro""
          },
          ""hello"",
          {
            ""type"": ""link"",
            ""label"": ""Google"",
            ""href"": ""http://google.com""
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    ""Category 2"": [""code""]
  },
  ""test"": {
    ""Test Ref links"": [
      {
        ""type"": ""doc"",
        ""id"": ""intro""
      },
      {
        ""type"": ""ref"",
        ""id"": ""code""
      }
    ]
  }
}
The type field can be one of the following:

doc — low level name for simple link to doc. Should contain id field
ref — link to some docId, but without binding this doc to current sidebar. Should contain id field
link — the type used to render any link in sidebar (doc and ref are converted to this type too). Should contain href and label fields
category — category :) should contain label and items fields (I think this should be a better name, because we will handle not only ids in this array)

I'm normalizing sidebars to this low-level format immediately after reading them (including versioned sidebars) in v2/lib/load/docs/sidebars.js. During normalization I'm checking, that all the items contain only allowed fields and that we won't have sub-sub-categories.
Normalized structure is much more predictable and reliable, which allow us to simplify logic (it won't be needed to test for each type of possible sidebar syntaxes in each function) during docs ordering and during sidebar rendering on client side. In future we can even more simplify this by implementing visitor pattern, like in e.g. babel.
Docs Paginator behavior
I've decided to ignore ref and link items, when building data for docs paginator. If you send user to ref doc, the sidebar will be changed. If you send user to link it may even leave our site. I think that's not expected behavior for the user.
Unit tests
I've added one new test to test for ref and link processing in order.js. All other cases seems to be covered with older tests after I've fixed them",5,6

Create learn/01-intro-to-muster.md

id: version-1.0.11-introduction
title: Introduction
original_id: introduction
---

Muster is a reactive state and data management library. It can:
- Collect data from multiple sources (user input, files, APIs, databases, etc.)
- Process the data in a reactive way, meaning that when the source (e.g. a file) changes, your logic that depends on that file gets re-run
- Manage dependencies between different pieces of logic
- Expose the data and logic as a graph
- Transparently handle synchronous and asynchronous data

![Muster Intro](assets/muster-intro.png)

Every Muster application expresses its data as a set of graph **nodes**, which can create links (dependencies) between each other. Muster introduces a concept of typed nodes, and different types of edges (called **operations**) between these nodes.

Muster operates a **virtual** graph, in the sense that Muster allows the creation of **matchers** which don’t exist in memory until they’re invoked – so the potential, virtual nodes are there but the actual entities haven’t yet been retrieved.

After

Solution Explained:
Simple regex fix. This is because we should lazyly quantify the preceding characters to match the subdirectories
Example:
version-.*?\/(.*\.md) for version-1.0.11/learn/01-intro-to-muster.md is learn/01-intro-to-muster.md
but version-.*\/(.*\.md) for version-1.0.11/learn/01-intro-to-muster.md is 01-intro-to-muster.md which is wrong",4,2

The reason for this bug that the previous Codeblock implementation separates
the tabs, the markdown before tabs, and the markdown after tabs into
separate Remarkable component, thus they don't share information
regarding the reference link
To solve this, change the Doc implementation so that one Doc
have only one Remarkable component by transforming the codeblock
into html string and add it as part of the markdown, letting the
Remarkable take care of the html string
However, this approach made us need to ensure that there is no
newline in the codetab, otherwise, the formatting inside the
code will be broken. Thus, I replace every newline inside the
code tag with a br tag

Fix #1215
Have you read the Contributing Guidelines on pull requests?
Yes
Test Plan
Create a referenced link with the reference located separately (one above the Codeblock tab, one below the Codeblock tab), e.g:

Add [You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1] anywhere above the Codeblock tab
Add [1]: http://slashdot.org anywhere below the Codeblock tab

Switch to MDX for v2. Might need more discussion since this is technically a move from remarkable to mdx as our markdown parser. Although i personally believe this shouldn't be a problem because we will allow user to choose their own markdown parser in v2 through plugins/ webpack config overriding.
Technically this is best done in v2 since v1 is not a SPA. So we will close #489

This patch resolves #1243. Docusaurus CLI command for building HTML files from MarkDown is docusaurus-build.  After deploying the static website as a result of this build, the documentation for the next release can be accessed by visiting **/next*. This is ideal for open source projects because it enables transperancy and encourages contribution. However, a closed source project will appreciate an option to skip building and deploying the next version documents. The proposed feature adds an option to docusaurus-build command to skip the build for documents of the next release. Thus, when docusaurus-build --skip-next-release is executed, the resulting HTML files are only for the already released version.

One thing to note is that we still put v2 as docusaurus-2 name for now, but we'll switch back to docusaurus later on when we really cut v1 branch on GitHub and remove v1 package. This is because yarn workspaces doesnt allow two package with same name (although different version)

Changes

Do not inject global metadata to context yet. Example: blogMetadata
Refactor plugins loading process to load/plugins
Simplify/ change the plugin lifecycles a bit.
Add configureWebpack plugin lifecycle

See below:
// A JavaScript class
class DocusaurusPlugin {
  constructor(options, context) {
    // Initialization hook
      
    // options are the plugin options set on config file
    this.options = {...options};
    
    // context are provided from docusaurus. Example: siteConfig can be accessed from context
    this.context = context;
  }

  getName() {
    // plugin name identifier
  }


  async loadContent()) {
    // The loadContent hook is executed after siteConfig and env has been loaded
    // You can return a JavaScript object 'content' that will be passed to contentLoaded hook
  }

  async contentLoaded({content, actions}) {
    // contentLoaded hook is done after loadContent hook is done
    // actions are set of functional API provided by Docusaurus. e.g: addRoute
  }

  configureWebpack(config, isServer) {
    // Modify internal webpack config. If returned value is an Object, it will be merged into the final config using webpack-merge; If returned value is a function, it will receive the config as the 1st argument and an isServer flag as the 2nd argument.
  }

  getPathsToWatch() {
    // path to watch
  }

Switch development server underlying library from webpack-serve to webpack-dev-server.

Inspired from jestjs/jest#7705
According to semantic versioning, X.Y.Z version means X is major, Y is minor and Z is patch
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
It's not a good idea for us to cut new docs for PATCH version because its only bug fixes and by right there shouldn't be much change to the documentation. It's also not good to keep too many version as that makes our build process even slower.

TL;DR See Test Plan
@yangshun mentioned to me on Discord that the hot-reload is actually not working. So I did some investigation and it was indeed not working. It fallbacks to page refresh.
It was because I forgot to correctly configure the module.hot 😢.  See https://webpack.js.org/guides/hot-module-replacement/.
Anyway. I learned a lot about Hot Module Replacement. Things are slightly more complicated on our side because in development: we are a SPA and in production: we are SSR + SPA. There is a reason why tools like create-react-app is very popular, hahaha. They settle this kind of things for us
However, I remembered Dan Abramov - Live React: Hot Reloading with Time Travel at react-europe 2015, so in this PR I added https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader to take the hot reload into next level. (Real-time hot reload)
Other changes:

Add --hot-only CLI options to let user disable fallback to full page refresh if hot-reload is not working
Use express.static to follow v1 way, contentBase should be the default publicPath
Add some TODO plugin hooks on devserver

Have you read the Contributing Guidelines on pull requests?

Development:
Before
Notice that there is a flash of screen. This is in fact a full page refresh. This is quite similar to v1 way of live reload.

After

Something to ponder: How do we apply different loaders for files with same extension?
Scenario

I want to load 'blog-xxxx.md' but only want the content summary
I want to load 'blog-xxxx.md', all of the content

The goal is to conditionally transform resources as needed just by appending a query parameter to the import statement.
Example:
import('blog/2018-09-11-Towards-Docusaurus-2.md?truncated=true')
Previously, our addRoute API looks like this
addRoute({
  // .....
  component: 'the/path/component/' // Only accepts string
})
Now we allow
addRoute({
  // .....
  component: {
     path: // the import path
     query: {
        // the query
    }
  }
})
Changes:

Blog plugin now no longer generates truncated version of blog (reduce bundle size).

Refactoring some common loaders to docs and blog plugin

See http://www.evernote.com/l/AqrzyoEn5d5BZ6z4HbV0YVcaulCnOF0blOk/ for initial idea
Initially I wanted to code-split it such that we have component.js as well for each route
Example:
For /blog/2017/12/14/introducing-docusaurus, we will create 3 new files

.docusaurus/blog-2017-12-14-introducing-docusaurus-8d2/component.js
.docusaurus/blog-2017-12-14-introducing-docusaurus-8d2/metadata.json
.docusaurus/blog-2017-12-14-introducing-docusaurus-8d2/modules.json

But after implementing it, I found that it makes us having to generate a lot of files and the bundle size actually become bigger due to module concatenation, files overhead, etc. Turns out that having one big single routes.js file is better than having small routes.js file + a lot of component.js file

So instead of that,
What I did in this PR is to make metadata as standalone modules. Allow possibility of reusing data.
For each route, the data is saved in a unique json path.
The algorithm is kebab case the url and append a hash to it. Very unlikely to have collision
Example: @generated/metadata/docs-commands-445.json
{
  ""id"": ""commands"",
  ""title"": ""CLI Commands"",
  ""language"": null,
  ""version"": null,
  ""source"": ""/mnt/c/Users/endij/Desktop/Linux/Docusaurus/docs/api-commands.md"",
  ""permalink"": ""/docs/commands"",
  ""localized_id"": ""commands"",
  ""sidebar"": ""docs"",
  ""category"": ""API"",
  ""next_id"": ""doc-markdown"",
  ""next"": ""doc-markdown"",
  ""previous_id"": ""versioning"",
  ""previous"": ""versioning"",
  ""previous_title"": ""Versioning"",
  ""next_title"": ""Markdown Features""
}

We also have a json mapping file called routesMetadataPath.json
Mapping of routePath -> metadataPath. Example: '/blog' -> '@generated/metadata/blog-c06.json'
Very useful to know which json metadata file is related to certain route
{
  ""/docs/versioning"": ""@generated/metadata/docs-versioning-8a8.json"",
  ""/docs/search"": ""@generated/metadata/docs-search-6da.json"",
  ""/blog"": ""@generated/metadata/blog-c06.json"",
  ""/"": ""@generated/metadata/-666.json"",
  ""/youtube"": ""@generated/metadata/youtube-429.json"",
  ""/feedback/"": ""@generated/metadata/feedback-7c7.json""
}
Extra:
routesAsyncModules.json
Mapping of routePath -> async imported modules. Example: '/blog' -> ['@theme/BlogPage']
Very useful to know what modules are async imported in a route
This will be used for my future use, like constructing prefetching based on viewport with intersection observer API

Edit: The idea here is to wait at make webpack compilation hook (https://webpack.js.org/api/compiler-hooks/#make) which is done before finishing the compilation.
This is roughly before static-site-generator-webpack-plugin begins to execute its function.
Note that we cannot do import manifest from XXXXX because at that time, the manifest still doesn't exist until client bundle finish serving.
We can however, do fs.existSync first at webpack level using our newly created WaitPlugin and then fs.readFileSync(manifest) later on.
Either way, it feels nicer to see the client and server bundle being run together

Add a ContentRenderer component that will help a component fetch the modules it needs based on the path provided.
Approach

Generate two files: registry.js and routesAsyncModules.json.

registry.js is simply a mapping of chunk names to their import statements.
routesAsyncModules.json is a mapping of routes to the chunks it needs, with the added benefit of having a shape


How ContentRenderer works:

In each component, (e.g. BlogPost or BlogPage), pass ContentRenderer the current path.
Look up routesAsyncModules with that path to get the chunks that are needed
Use React Loadable to load the chunks in parallel and pass them back to the component.



End Result

Cleaner and smaller routes file. The route files no longer have the import statements for modules. TODO: Make metadata use a similar approach. Eventually the routes file will be very clean and lean, as we're de-compiling the code and providing the dependent modules to React Loadable during runtime. Eventually for each route it will just be as simple as below, without any of the metadata/modules stuff.

  path: '/blog/2017/12/14/introducing-docusaurus',

Link prefetching is a browser mechanism, which utilizes browser idle time to download or prefetch documents that the user might visit in the near future. A web page provides a set of prefetching hints to the browser, and after the browser is finished loading the page, it begins silently prefetching specified documents and stores them in its cache. When the user visits one of the prefetched documents, it can be served up quickly out of the browser's cache.
Description
Enable prefetching from anywhere. There is now some sort of api runner called __docusaurus in window that provides user some powerful utility function like prefetch. Prefetching is inspired from Gatsby. https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/how-code-splitting-works/
But we are not just limited to viewport, we allow prefetching from anywhere  !!
It is now possible in the future to make it such that:

Doc page can prefetch next and previous pages
Prefetch link if that link is on viewport (through Intersection Observer API)
etc

Implementation
First of all, we need to understand that there are webpack chunk names and chunk assets
This is chunk-map manifest
""component---theme-doc-body-f68"": [ // webpack chunk name
    ""/component---theme-doc-body-f68.9967d7798f71bc4d085e.css"", // chunk assets
    ""/component---theme-doc-body-f68.9967d7798f71bc4d085e.js"" // chunk assets
  ],
In Docusaurus 2, every route is code-spliited, and there are chunk names associated with each route.
For example: component---theme-doc-body-f68, module---docs-commands-172-0af and metadata---docs-commandsa-60-e10 chunk names are related to route /docs/commands
General flow ?
From the routePath (for example: /docs/commands, we can infer all the related webpack chunk names. From that webpack chunk names, we can get all the webpack chunk assets. We then prefetch all those chunk assets.

If intersection observer is supported:
Once the current page has loaded, looks for all links on the viewport, and for each starts prefetching the page that the link points to.


If IO is not supported.
Once the current page has loaded, looks for all links on the page, and for each starts prefetching the page that the link points to.

When running docusaurus-init, the examples docs and blog are created in directories suffixed with -examples-from-docusaurus which is really unnecessary friction. Most people would not have those directories already there, especially for the blog directory. Hence I'm changing it to directly creating the correct directories and for the docs, falling back to the examples dir if docs dir already exists.

TL;DR: see test plan or check https://deploy-preview-1383--docusaurus-2.netlify.com/
When routes take a long time to load, we’ll want to display some sort of loading indicator to the user.
Example:

However, if our internet speed is super slow. It can be very annoying to see a blank page and a spinner
What we'd really like to do is to display a loading bar over the current page while the next route loads… well, unless the transition only takes 100ms. Then you probably just want to keep displaying the current page until the next one is ready, because showing a loading bar for only 100ms also looks bad

Inspired by YouTube and Medium style progress bar, here is what the flow for our app looks like

When routes navigation happens (e.g: when you click <Link /> component, we trick the user by rendering the old route screen while trying to preload the next route screen. Only after the promise is resolved, we renders the next route screen.
However, if within one second it still doesnt resolve, a loading progress bar (like medium/youtube) is displayed to make user perceive there is some loading state.
The 1 second timeout is based on https://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/. In fact, I copied the timeout from Gatsby 😄 .

You can try opening this PR's netlify, it is almost impossible now to see blank page and a spinner.

their publish date. This commit adds the ability to hide a specific blog
post from the sidebar and the feed of all blog posts by adding the
unlisted: true header option.
Fixes #1393.

Motivation
The motivation for this feature is to make it possible to change dates of published posts without breaking the old URL (which might be widely shared).
Concrete example, we published a blog post two weeks ago that is dated for 2020 (https://scalameta.org/metals/blog/2020/04/12/mercury.html). We have closed three PRs fixing the date (scalameta/metals#683, scalameta/metals#670, scalameta/metals#656) but they have all been closed because changing the date of the post would turn the old URL into a 404.
With the ability to unlist posts, I could unlist the 2020 post, create a new posts dated in 2019 and update the unlisted 2020 post to forward to the new 2019 post.
I'm open for alternative solutions to fix that particular problem. I think unlisting is a flexible solution that could be useful in other situations as well, for example when writing a draft post.
Have you read the Contributing Guidelines on pull requests?
Yes.
Test Plan
I would appreciate help for testing this change since I'm unfamiliar with jest (and JavaScript in general 😅 ). I created a blog post in __test__/__fixtures__ using unlisted: true and ran yarn test and everything passed but I expected some snapshot tests to fail.
I tested the change manually on our website and it seems to work as expected:

Observe that uncommenting unlisted: true makes the post disappear from both the sidebar and the list of all blog posts while the post is still published under the unchanged URL.

I removed i18n and translation from the codebase. It's better to not ship a WIP code when we release the first alpha public release.

I also moved all the test to be co-located with its corresponding files.

I realized theming can be done almost solely via webpack aliases. Drawing lots of inspiration from VuePress, this is how we will do theming:

A theme is a plugin and its main purpose is to provide components and set webpack aliases for them. It can implement the content fetching lifecycles and we don't prevent if from doing that, but it's probably a bad idea and people shouldn't do it. Why I differentiate them from plugins is because I want all the themes to only be initialized and its configureWebpack method to run after all the plugins, that way, the component overriding order is guaranteed.
The content plugins will provide its corresponding components along with the respective aliases.
For components that aren't tied to any content, put them under a default theme.
If users want to override any component, they can add a component under the same name in website/theme/ dir, e.g. website/theme/DocPaginator.js.
Presets can now include themes on top of plugins (and only limited to themes and plugins).

RFC
This approach works well, but is not without drawbacks. @endiliey I wanna get your comments on the following:

If someone overrides a theme component and later removes the theme, that overridden component will still be there in the code but doesn't do anything. It wouldn't get bundled into the final bundle but dead code can be a maintenance burden in future.
We now have 3 things to teach users - plugins, themes, and presets. Themes are plugins, so that's easy to teach. Presets is a collection of themes and plugins but its shape is similar to docusaurus.config.js and people might get confused and start putting other keys into presets. I wonder if it'll be easier to just make everything work the same way - everything is a plugin and plugins can include more plugins and themes. IMO this will just create a huge mess of plugin inheritance and I rather try to keep the hierarchy flat. WDYT?
I currently provide the theme components for docs and blog within its content plugin because they're related and a content plugin cannot work without the default components. Do you think it's cleaner to just make those components as part of a separate theme e.g. docusaurus-theme-blog and docusaurus-theme-docs and have the preset include the individual themes? The original rationale for putting them together was that if someone just wants the blog, they can include one plugin and they're good to go, rather than installing a plugin AND a theme.
Almost every user that needs just a bit of customization will need to override Layout.js so I wonder if it's better putting it as part of the default theme vs scaffolding for people.
People will have to use Infima CSS as the default theme. If they want to user another CSS framework, they'll have to override almost all the components 😱
Because the webpack aliases are generated only once when the dev server starts, any addition or removal will require restarting the dev server. VuePress also suffers from this problem. There's probably a way around this though, by watching the files and restarting the dev server when there are changes

Continuation of #1435
Ejecting theme from plugin to override it easily

Most of the time, user will only want to tweak the theme component a little bit.
Instead of manually copying the files for component overriding, we allow a very simple command that will copy the theme plugin folder into website/theme. They can delete any of those components that they don't want to override. This is just for easier DX
Example:
yarn eject @docusaurus/theme-classic
Demo:

Refactoring
Instead of having the theme plugin to resolve alias everytime like this
https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/blob/3298d8cd231835a74abe85649bc20c3296fe3711/packages/docusaurus-theme-classic/src/index.js#L22-L35
We can provide a plugin API
get themePath() {
  return '/path/to/the/theme/folder'
}
Then we'll programatically create alias from that theme folder (we already did it for the shadowing component a.k.a child theme)
Note that the hard requirement for theme is that all theme components must use the @theme alias to refer to other components. If they use relative paths to reference other components, the code will break since the relative path does not exist on our child theme folder located on sitedir.
The argument for doing alias one by one was to not expose certain components, but I think all the components in theme folder must be exposed and aliased. Because if they are being used, they have to be referred using @theme alias instead of relative path.
Example
Parent Theme (@docusaurus/theme-docs)
theme
├── components
│   ├── PostItem.js
│   ├── Sidebar.js
├── BlogListPage.js (depends on PostItem)
└── BlogPostPage.js 

Child Theme wanted to override/ tweak the BlogListPage a little bit.
theme
├── BlogListPage.js

If we use alias for everything, the child theme that shadows parent theme can still use the reusable block such as PostItem.
If we don't expose PostItem as an alias, component shadowing BlogListPage requires us to re-create all the PostItem/ non exposed component)

Background
Docusaurus currently doesn't have any static typing and this has been a painful point for us the maintainers of this repo. In order to move faster and confidently in the future, we have decided to add static typing to our codebase, in particular for Docusaurus 2 codebase while it is still not mature yet.
We, the Docusaurus core team have privately discussed on whch static typing to choose initially and we came to decide between Flow, ReasonML and Typescript.
Initially we decided to go with Flow (because me and Yangshun is familiar with it) but after trying it, we decided to drop it. The library definition is much less than Typescript and the community is smaller too. It makes much more sense to use TS rather than Flow if what we want is just an addition to JavaScript.
We are also very influenced by other popular OSS project move to TS (Example: jestjs/jest#7554)
However, we also decided to try ReasonML because it has a rock solid type system and it looks very promising. At first, we are quite happy with it but we realize that the learning curve is too steep and the community is even smaller. It's a very risky move to use ReasonML and that will make our external contributors even less. Nobody is working on Docusaurus full-time, so to keep the project alive, we'll have to rely on contributors.
So, we decided to go with Typescript. We believe the complexity of adding static typing is worth it in the long-term. We can write codes more confidently (looking at you, JavaScript :)) and it will be easier for new contributors to understand the codebase.
Changes
So, this PR is the very beginning move of Docusaurus to Typescript. Starting with @docusaurus/utils
I think this is a good start. Will be adding more in the future
Extra changes:

Upgrade webpack-dev-server
Add yarn start and yarn build command at root to make it easier to start website without having to go to website directory (cd website)
