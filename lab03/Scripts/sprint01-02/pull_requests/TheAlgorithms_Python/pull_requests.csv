Sherman-Morrison formula is important to reduce time complexity on calculating inverse matrix on some special cases. This formula is also used to improve BFGS update performance. For deeper stuffs please look into this documents:

I still need to add determinants, cofactors, etc. but I thought it might be good to post this and see if I got any advice / criticisms of things to think or if you guys thought it looked good to keep going the way it is.  I just noticed that you guys are now recommending running Python Black, which I haven't done yet but will get to soon.  Anyway, let me know what you think!",3,8
