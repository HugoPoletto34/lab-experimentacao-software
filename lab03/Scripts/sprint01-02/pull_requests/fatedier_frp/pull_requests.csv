权限问题。监听 127.0.0.1 只用于本地或者 nginx 反代等特定方式访问，或仅用于内网等场景的访问。虽然防火墙能够做到，但此功能不应与防火墙耦合。对外暴露的验证也不是绝对的安全。实现场景类似 tomcat 默认的 manager 及 host-manager 配置，需手动添加授权用户且默认只允许 127.0.0.1 本地访问。

The client and server services now only attempt to load assets if the dashboard or admin panel are enabled. This change makes it possible to use FRP as a library without having to manage assets.
If a library user wants to start a server with the dashboard enabled, they will need to set the DashboardPort and AssetsDir fields of ServerCommonConf.
If a library use wants to start a client with the admin panel enabled, that isn't currently possible because there's no way to customize the admin panel's assets directory. I can send a PR for that as well if there's interest.

When the frps have massive concurrent connection establishments(especially for long-lived connections, e.g. http2, WebSocket), frps will use many file descriptors(expected behaviours), and eventually reach the ulimit -n limit.
After that the frps proxy listener simply log and quit, and the whole frps is refused to accepting any further connections.
Which is prone to DDOS attacks.
How to reproduce this bug
frps
No config file required, just use the defaults.
frpc
client.ini
[common]
server_addr = 127.0.0.1
server_port = 7000

[too-many-open-files-test]
type = tcp
remote_port = 1053
# Change to yours
local_ip = 192.168.200.1
local_port = 53
Why use DNS for test: simply because it's relative long-lived, anything else would be ok.
concurrent-conn.sh
#!/bin/bash

while :; do
    # Fire and forget(reach `ulimit -n` quickly)
    dig @127.0.0.1 -p1053 dns.google +tcp +short > /dev/null &
done
Reproduce procedures
Env: Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS x86_64

./frps
./frpc -c client.ini
prlimit --pid $(pidof frps) --nofile=128:128
Explicitly decrease nofile limit of frps to reach ulimit -n quickly
prlimit --pid $(pidof frpc) --nofile=102400:102400
Explicitly increase nofile limit of frpc so frpc won't be the bottleneck
