RTP3
RTP Internacional
RTP Memória
RTP Madeira
RTP Açores
RTP África
(Public broadcasting station channels in the qualities available at the official site)
ARTV (parliament channel)
Porto Canal (private channel owned by FC Porto football club)


Removed the link for RTP1 and added the one from the official page.

A couple notes about the RTP streams:

These are the streams used in the official page (https://www.rtp.pt/play/), they're fast, have good image quality and are stable but there are two issues:

When any of these channels is broadcasting a programme it doesn't have the rights to broadcast online (usually that's imported programmes) the m3u file will be empty, it may seem the stream is broken but it'll continue streaming as soon as this programme ends.
It doesn't work with Kodi's user-agent (and probably most IPTV apps' user-agents), but all streams are available just using ""Mozilla"" as a user-agent. I tried all links on Kodi for a couple days and they're all working. Maybe it should be noted on the README file that some streams may not work with the default user-agent.


The RTP1 stream that was on the list was working but I think it's better to have the official good quality stream rather than this low quality stream of an unknown source.
I used the tvg-id and tvg-name from https://siptv.eu/codes/ and https://www.iptv-epg.com/available-channels as these seem the most standard, this way it's more likely to work with most EPG sources.",4,7

This is channel about caça, hunting, not caca, poo.

Added LQ, MQ and HQ to low, medium and hight quality streams, so there aren't three streams with the same name.
Added category ""Hobby"" which seems the most appropriate given the choice, even if I don't like calling it that.



TV Fátima

Removing duplicate stream: both streams seem the same, it's just one has the domain name the other IP number. URL is otherwise the same, both .m3u8 can be found both ways. Leaving the one with the domain name because it's more recognizable but changed to the livestream.m3u8 file because it includes metadata.
Added tvg-id and tvg-name from the provided EPG file.
Added category.



Porto Canal

Added category.



Sobrenatural TV

Added category.
Appended ""(backup)"" to the second stream's name.



Kuriakos TV

Added category.
Appended ""(backup)"" to the second stream's name.



Kuriakos Kids

Changed category from Kids to Religious



Note: This choice of categories may be controversial. Both Sobrenatural TV and Kuriakos TV are owned by evangelical churches and claim to be general content, family oriented channels, but actually looking at the programming it's clear most of it is selling Jesus or the bible. The point of claiming they're not a religious channel is to proselytise to people who wouldn't usually look at religious channels. If we just take their word and mark it as general we are helping their cause, not being accurate. The music and movies channel are different because these kind of channels often are themed (horror movies, classical music...) so having a music channel with a Christian theme is fine, I think. The Kids channel worries me especially, most people will let children watch kids channels assuming the shows are either entertaining or educational, but this channel also includes a lot of evangelical propaganda directed at children, with the purpose of converting or instilling dogma. I believe it should be marked as religious. Religious people are free to watch it and force it on their children, but people who don't want this shouldn't be led to do it just because the channel was marked as ""Kids"" TV. I'm explaining myself here because this will apply to other channels and you might not agree, so I'm making my reasoning clear.

Removed

FM O Dia TV because it is:

Not a TV channel (it seems a web stream from a radio station that isn't even broadcasting any video content except for the logo).
Not Portuguese, it's Brazilian.
Repeated, it's already on the Brazil list.


TV Maná Córdoba because it is a religious TV channel from a Portuguese Evangelical church but it is in Spanish and intended for Argentina. It's also repeated, it's already in the Argentina list.
TVI Reality because it isn't working, at least not for me, and I can watch the official stream which requires a dynamically generated token. The domain is the same, this might just be an old link.",2,3
