Currently, if you return a BaseModel instance in a route with a BaseModel response_type, the skip_defaults value does not influence the result. This PR fixes this.

Details
The source of the problem is that calling field.validate on a model results in a new model with the fields set. I dug in on the pydantic side and it looks like this is due to the recent change to re-parse the model with a non-subclass type when response_model is set. If you look in BaseModel.validate (which is ultimately called if you follow it deep enough), you can see the precise spot where defaults aren't being skipped:
@classmethod
    def validate(cls: Type['Model'], value: Any) -> 'Model':
        if isinstance(value, dict):
            return cls.parse_obj(value)
        elif isinstance(value, cls):
            return value.copy()
        elif cls.__config__.orm_mode:
            return cls.from_orm(value)
        else:
            with change_exception(DictError, TypeError, ValueError):
                return cls.parse_obj(value)
It calls into parse_obj on the last line, which subsequently calls dict on the object and then parses the dict. Unfortunately, this means defaults don't get skipped.
I don't think it makes sense to change this on the pydantic side because otherwise you'd run into problems parsing models with default values into non-subclass models with required values. So, if we want to stick with this approach of creating a new class to force a reparse, we probably need to handle the

That said, I would also be in favor of a larger refactor if we could come up with a way to get the desired field safely without another round of parsing/dumping 😬. But that does seem hard.",2,2

There is a lot of custom functionality that this change would simplify, but there are two especially important capabilities it adds:

A way to get handle exceptions with access to the request body
A way to modify the request body prior to its parsing/handling by FastAPI

I've added two sections to the ""Using the Request Directly"" docs showing how to use the changes in this PR to implement both of the above kinds of feature.

There have been many recent github issues that could be better-addressed with this capability.
Related to accessing the body in middleware/exception handlers:

#180 accessing request body in middleware
#375 accessing request body in exception handlers
#394 accessing request body in middleware
#575 accessing request body in exception handlers
encode/starlette#493 accessing request body in exception handlers (using fastapi)
encode/starlette#495  a variety of use cases involving accessing request body in middleware (some using fastapi)

Related to modifying the request prior to handling by FastAPI:

#521 support for msgpack-encoded requests
encode/starlette#644 support for gzip-encoded requests (using fastapi)


Quoting Tom Christie from encode/starlette#495:

""Consume request body in middleware is problematic""
Indeed. Consuming request data in middleware is problematic.
Not just to Starlette, but generally, everywhere.
On the whole you should avoid doing so if at all possible.

I think using middleware to consume the request body is the obvious (or, perhaps, ""naive"") way to handle these issues. But that approach is explicitly discouraged, and not supported. So I think the approach described in / supported by this PR is especially valuable.

(This pull request is in lieu of #568, and includes what I think is both the smallest and most important change to APIRoute from that pull request.)",2,2

With inspiration from @dmontagu 's #570.
This handles dependencies that yield by converting them into a sync or async context manager,  depending on the function. And runs them in a ""context manager stack"".
This way, the order of dependencies is preserved and cleanup/closing happens in the correct order (the first dependency called is cleaned last).
This also means that dependencies that require other dependencies will still have them on scope during cleanup. So, contextmanager-style dependencies that require other contextmanager dependencies will have access to them during cleanup.
When a dependency function is a normal function (not async), the context manager is called in a threadpool (__enter__), so, the same as with normal dependencies, it's safe to do non-async blocking IO in contextmanager style dependencies. E.g. start a DB connection, probably the main use-case for this. And the same for cleaning it up (__exit__).
This works by default in Python 3.7.
And works in Python 3.6 if the backports are installed:

async-exit-stack
async-generator

pip install async-exit-stack async-generator
But they are not forced/required dependencies. If an app doesn't use context managers and still runs in Python 3.6, it will still work without the backports.
...Although I suspect most of the apps will use this for DB connections.
These backport dependencies are checked on app initialization, so, if a contextmanager-style dependency function (with yields) is found, the environment is not Python 3.7+, and the backports are not installed, it will raise a RuntimeError right away on app initialization (so, no risk for the error lurking into a prod environment).

TODO:

 Fix mypy types.
 Extend tests to check for correct order of contextmanager dependencies with subdependencies.
 Extend tests to verify that background tasks can still access the dependencies from context managers (e.g. DB connections).

Fixing the immediate problem only required removing a brittle runtime type check of each model field in a responses arg (passed to APIRoute.__init__). Putting in a more robust version seemed to lead inexorably to making changes in a few other places.
The same type checking effectively happens in parts of the code that accept a type and returns a pydantic.ModelField. As it turns out, that logic is repeated in a number of places:

Processing any model fields in the responses arg to APIRoute.__init__
Doing the same for the response_model arg to APIRoute.__init__
At various places in fastapi.dependencies.utils: here, here, here

Given that, it seemed best to factor out that logic into a standalone function, for the sake of DRYness. That also makes it easier to raise fastapi-specific exceptions, with clearer error messages, when invalid types are passed. And it means that the model args in responses and model_field undergo the same type checking.",2,2

This is a feature request.
When I was working with FastAPI I thought that it will be a great idea to use function return type annotation as default response_model for an endpoint.
For instance, we have a simple application:
from pydantic import BaseModel

from fastapi import FastAPI


class Model(BaseModel):
    name: str


app = FastAPI()


@app.get(""/"", response_model=Model)
def endpoint():
    return Model(name=""Yurii"")
So with this PR, it can be rewritten to:
from pydantic import BaseModel

from fastapi import FastAPI


class Model(BaseModel):
    name: str


app = FastAPI()


@app.get(""/"")
def endpoint() -> Model:
    return Model(name=""Yurii"")
In case when response_model argument set and return type annotation present, then response_model will be used.",8,19

We'll be leveraging the [import].__package__ field as a way to determine if the CORRECT multipart import was used or not.
Oddly enough, the incorrect multipart import will have a .__package__ field value of """" (empty string). The correct import, python-multipart, will have a .__package__ field value of ""multipart"".
We'll check to see if the user will be using forms or not with is_form_data(BodyFieldInfo). If this evaluates to true, then we can check to see there is a multipart import at all by using importlib.util.find_spec(""multipart""). If that again evaluates to true, we can check the .__package__ value to see if it is an empty string or not.
Alternative solution:
Instead of testing the imports' .__package__ field, we could try to wrap a try / catch with a method exclusive to python-multipart that is not in multipart instead. If an exception was caught we know it's also the wrong import.
parser = multipart.QuerystringParser() might be a good method to try out.",5,2

This PR adds support for specifying extra info for the JSON schema of path operations. This is so that OpenAPI extensions can be used when declaring routes.
Use case
We need this because we rely on open api extensions to configure our service mesh (linkerd) for retries and timeouts, but there are probably many use cases for this.
Implementation

There is a lot of boilerplate to add support for extra arguments, but it does not look like there is a way around it. Suggestions welcome.
The pydantic model of Operation accepts any extra info, which matches the behavior of Path, Field, Query, etc. There might be an argument to restrict it to x- prefixed fields, but this will be more complex. I'm not sure it is worth it.",6,10

Just some small (potential) improvements to the tutorial, adding required dependency installations that are otherwise not mentioned in their corresponding tutorial sections.
Reasoning:
Although:

They are mentioned (with the exception of SQLAlchemy) in the documentation home page (docs/index.md) under the section ""Optional Dependencies""
The tutorial home page (docs/tutorial/index.md) recommends installing FastAPI with all the optional dependencies and features (i.e., pip install fastapi[all])
Corresponding error messages make it fairly obvious as to what dependencies are missing and need to be installed

These additions may still be helpful for beginners and seem to be in keeping with the style of the documentation as a whole (i.e., standalone sections).",6,7

Add API Documentation section on our documentation.
Add mkdocstrings plugin on mkdocs.
Add initial docstrings following Google style.

UJSONResponse was removed from the core as per this issue, they added documentation on how to implement custom JSON serialization. UJSONResponse is explicitly exported in FastAPI and should either be removed to follow starlette or added back in as done with ORJSONResponse. For this PR I chose to add a custom UJSONResponse and add test cases.

Currently the docs say to use orjson for speed, but then demonstrate returning a dictionary, which in my experience can be very slow. The main speed improvement I have found is in returning Responses directly, which avoids the call to jsonable_encoder.
Below are results from some tests I did with 7MB+ json data. These are real world and include round trips to the database so to see such a huge effect is rather amazing to me.
To be clear, the difference here is just returning an explicit ORJSONResponse object, vs. JSONResponse object vs. a dict and letting fastapi inspect it. The data returned are exactly the same in all cases.

For more examples w/ code demonstrating the differences see here:
https://github.com/falkben/fastapi_experiments/blob/master/experiments/orjson_response.py
and some tests here:
https://github.com/falkben/fastapi_experiments/blob/master/experiments/test_orjson_response.py
In those tests I observed a 6x slowdown when returning a dictionary vs. returning a Response directly

Now it is possible to handle and raise exceptions in exit code of dependencies yield.

from fastapi import Depends

async def dependency(value):
    print(""1 - Before yield"")
    yield value

@app.get(""/dependency"")
async def endpoint(value=Depends(dependency, exit_before_response=True)):

Considerations:

This approach has the problem of ""order matters"" between get() and head() methods, meaning that if the get() is implemented first, the head() is ignored.
It does not make it optional adding the HEAD to OpenAPI, it just doesn't include it. If we want to make it optional we can add a include_head_schema on the HTTP method methods.

More like a prototype of /liveness and /readiness endpoints supported natively.
Proposed Solution 😎
This solution proposes storing the probes_state. In that state, we define two attributes: alive and ready. Based on those two attributes, we're able to change the response of the liveness and readiness probes.
Those two attributes can be changed at any moment using the request.app.probes_state.<alive|ready> for now. This is obviously a solution that @tiangolo will not accept, neither I think is a good one. 😅 I think we should have a duck typed solution here. That being said, some ideas:

Global variable imported instead of storing the state inside the FastAPI class (which doesn't look that good and it will be exceptional way to do something in FastAPI), for instance:

from fastapi import probes_state

Provide a new object the same way BackgroundTasks and Request is inserted, for instance:

from fastapi import FastAPI, LivenessState, ReadinessState

app = FastAPI()

@app.get(""/"")
async def potato(liveness_state: LivenessState, readiness_state: ReadinessState):
    liveness_state.broken() # Turn alive to False
    liveness_state.correct() # Turn alive to True
    readiness_state.accepting_traffic() # Turn ready to True
    readiness_state.refusing_traffic() # Turn ready to False  
Pros ✔️

Looks like people want this feature (check related issue thumbs up).

Cons ❌

Easy to implement i.e. doesn't need to be on FastAPI natively.

def get_users():
    return ['Jake', 'Dave', 'Aly']


app.include_router(router)
The parameter name is up for discussion, I think something like router_prefix may get the wrong point across (like a default prefix for routers). So an ambigious prefix correctly gets the point of a global prefix for all routes correctly across.
One downside with this change is how it does what Nginx or Apache usually handles, and we probably want users to use those in many cases. But I think that this is easy enough of a change and should be available to the user.
