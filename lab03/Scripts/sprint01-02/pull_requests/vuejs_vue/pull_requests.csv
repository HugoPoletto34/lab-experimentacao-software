3710,2016-09-20T20:00:18Z,,2016-10-12T04:56:07Z,5,124,1,"Function as a child is a very powerful pattern employed in react.  It allows the consumer of a component to choose how to render a component, while having access to data passed down by the parent.
It is similar to slots, in a way, except slots only gain you access to the data in the hosting component.
For more information on the possibilities that this pattern enables, please see this blog post, this presentation from Ryan Florence at React Rally, as well as the new API for React Router 4.0.
Before I go on, I do want to say that the pattern is achievable right now using props:
It is possible now to mimic this using props with the following pattern:
const ComponentWithInfo = {
    props: ['render'],
    render (h) {
       return this.render('Hello, World');
    }
}

new Vue({
    render (h) {
         return <ComponentWithData render={data => <span>{data}</span>}></ComponentWithData>
    }
})

However, ""first-class"" support would be nice.
As far as the vue flavor, the API looks like this:
const ComponentWithInfo = {
    render (h) {
       return this.$slots.default('Hello, World')
    }
}

new Vue({
    render (h) {
         return <ComponentWithData>{data => <span>{data}</span>}</ComponentWithData>
    }
})

A couple of things:

In my implementation, if an array is passed for children, and any of the children are a function, that will throw away all children, except for the function

The basic idea here is, skip checking async component when hydration. To support this, I introduced a new flag on VNode isAsyncPlaceholder. A placeholder VNode is same as an emptyVNode, except the new flag set to true. Before this commit, an async component will be rendered to emptyVNode(in createElement). After this commit, an async component will be rendered to placeholderVNode. So the behavior in client-side rendering or bailed SSR rendering should be kept.
In SSR hydration, we skip checking a placeholder VNode against a real element. After component is resolved, the Vue instance in question will $forceUpdate in callback. So even if the real element dismatches with resolved VNode, rendered dom structure should be up to date.
Current implementation cannot reuse dom for async component because isHydrating is not available in createComponent.
Another potential problem is that third party code can attach event handler / store data on SSR element. Those information will be lost in $forceUpdate callback. But I would suggest library users should care about it because I wonder if a library can provide a silver-bullet strategy.",4,9

I am working on integration of Vue with Meteor and I would like that Vue could be a drop-in replacement for Blaze. That is almost possible, because architecture is very similar. Vue is also using reactive dependency tracking, observer, while Meteor/Blaze is using Tracker. Now, there is a lot of code written for Meteor which is using Tracker and it would be great if it could just work with Vue. And in fact it is doable. I managed to create a full 100% compatible Tracker implementation on top of Vue's observer. But there are some changes necessary to observer's implementation and some internals have to be exposed.
This pull request is initial version of changes I had to do to get this first version of Tracker implemented, to get discussion rolling. I would really like to see if this or something like this could get merged into Vue. From my perspective changes do not really change how observer is working, and all existing tests are still passing.
A list of changes:

added support for after flush callbacks
adding a way to force flushing
fixed exception recovery for pushTarget/popTarget
correctly cleanup queue if there is an exception from getter
exposing some internals (probably too much, API could be cleaner there)

Since Vue decided to bundle its definition files, they were hosted on DefinitelyTyped.

DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped#13236

However, as these PRs imply, vue.d.ts was removed and currently there's no way to manage the 1.x's one.
In addition, there were a lot of changes between 2.x's and 1.x's definition, such as vuejs namespace, plural or singular. So I changed its content in order to allow users to use what version they like with TypeScript.
Of course, the past definitions were written for TS 1.x, but this one is for TS 2.x.

From the discussions here:
https://forum.vuejs.org/t/hide-notify-you-are-running-vue-in-development-mode/5661
and here:

and because it also annoys me, I decided to try and set up a flag, which will allow a dev to ""consciously"" remove the production tips info.
It is also related to (requires) this PR for the webpack template.
vuejs-templates/webpack#510
The flag is currently set to ""false"", so the client dev will have to go into the file and set it to true, to remove the production tips info.
If you let me know how to best document the availability of the flag (if the two PRs get accepted), I'd be also glad to add into about the flag to the docs too.
Also, this currently only works for the webpack setup. I haven't looked into the other build possibilities.

4975,2017-02-20T10:38:07Z,,2017-07-11T02:31:53Z,9,140,19,"Currently, whenever you call Vue.set or Vue.delete, all observers on the object being modified are executed.  This is a ""safe"" practice, because it ensures that any objects who had previously attempted to access the key being added or deleted get their dependencies re-computed.
However, consider the case where you have an object with many different keys and watchers, which might be expensive to call.  In this case, Vue.set will do a lot of work executing all of the watchers, even if none of them respond to the new field in the object, causing poor performance.
Here is a fiddle to demonstrate the issue: https://jsfiddle.net/exe3nxzg/2/ .  Adding new keys to the object causes the watcher on the original field to be triggered, even though that watcher doesn't care about the values of the new keys.
This PR offers a possible fix to the problem, which is to add an options object as the final argument of Vue.set and Vue.delete.  If the user wishes to manually suppress notifications on the object and prevent all watchers from being computed, they can pass { notify: false } as the final argument.
Another possible fix would be to add a new function called Vue.get.  If Vue.set replaces the syntax obj[key]=value and Vue.delete replaces the syntax delete obj[key], then Vue.get would replace the syntax obj[key] || default.  More precisely, a definition could look something like:
Vue.get = function(obj, key, defaultValue) {
	if (!obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
		// create the key on the object with the default value.
		// call defineReactive(), etc.
		// however, do NOT call notify on the object.
	}
	return obj[key];
};
This way, whenever a key access is attempted, a reactive is left behind, such that setting the property in the future, even via Vue.set, will not cause a full notify.
Thoughts?",5,6
4994,2017-02-23T23:34:47Z,,2017-04-17T04:07:12Z,195,46387,21856,"When exploring css-in-js solutions for vue, I came across the fact that some auto prefixed style objects (for example, by postcss-js) cannot be directly used as style option on elements, when they have an array as value, e.g.
{ display: ['-webkit-box', '-webkit-flex', '-ms-flexbox', 'flex'] }

...which happens when a rule value needs to be prefixed, other examples:
{ backgroundImage: ['radial-gradient(...)', '-webkit-radial-gradient(...)']
{ cursor: ['-webkit-grab','grab'] }

This PR adds support for directly consuming such objects as style option.
This is really an edge case (inline style option + style object with value as an array), so I totally understand if this is not going into the core.

So instead of:

TS users should now use:

...which is consistent with recommended plain ES usage.
This is technically a breaking change, but since we've already unintentionally caused a breaking change for webpack 2 + TS users, we should probably just fully migrate to ES-based exports to avoid more breakage in the future.

Hi,
Please see #5145
This patch adds a warning when user is not passing props in kebab-case mistakenly, for example:
<foo someProp=""bar""></foo>
should be
<foo some-prop=""bar""></foo>
I know this is stated on the guide, but since it's a very common mistake (based on the questions on stackoverflow (see the issue above) and the forum), I think it is worth to add a warning and I believe this will save a lot of people's debugging time and provide a more friendly development experience.
And for the performance, this is not a complex algorithm. It only adds a fews operations (both toLowerCase and hasOwnProperty are fast enough) in O(n) so I would say the impact on performance is negligible (almost no impact when running unit test on my machine).
thanks!",3,4

Sorry for not following the ""Ideally you should open a suggestion issue first and have it greenlighted before working on it."" rule, no loss on my side if you don't want to accept this.
I would like this feature as it will allow Vue to call a user provided callback for warnings which helps for asserting the state of warnings during testing or development, without having to either spyon or monkeypatch the console.error function.

5887,2017-06-14T23:07:28Z,,2017-08-29T14:36:49Z,17,1900,661,"This PR improves the Vue .d.ts files so that users can get some improved inference when using the noImplicitThis compiler option. It takes advantage of many of the features the TypeScript team has been working on over the last few versions. Thus, it requires a minimum TypeScript version of 2.4. You can get this working with the current typescript@next (which is 2.5.0-dev.20170614, but don't let that version number fool you - this will work with the final release of 2.4).
The best part about this change is that it makes using Vue easier when users choose not to use classes and inheritance. In other words, users and can more easily new up an instance using the Vue constructor, and can create components using the Vue.extend and Vue.component APIs a little more naturally. Extending Vue as a class will still work, so if you prefer to use vue-class-component and the rest, that should still work! However, those dependencies may need to be updated for this change.
There's definitely some amount of complexity that's been introduced but I'm willing to iterate on this with the help of others. Given the feedback that we've heard on TypeScript-Vue-Starter, it's been a positive experience for users.
Fixes many of the issues users have asked about in #478.
Tests are probably failing at this point because I need to update the project's dependency on TypeScript.",16,34

Key improvements:

More backward compatible via generic default
Props type inference

@ktsn @kaorun343 @DanielRosenwasser Your reviews or suggestions are welcome!

This section provides more background for other reviewers/readers.
Vue + TS users currently need helper library like vue-component-class to provide alternative API for TypeScript. Alternative API uses code pattern that TypeScript recognizes, but it splits Vue community.
Thankfully, TypeScript introduces ThisType which can greatly improve Vue's canonical API. This PR introduces ThisType to Vue's official typing.
More importantly, this  improvement also benefits JavaScript users! VSCode users or Vue-language-server users exploits TypeScript compiler to provide editor services for JavaScript. Thus the typing improvement can help JavaScript completion more intelligent.
Goal:

Provide good enough completions for both JS users and new TS users (if they use canonical API).
Don't break existing TS libraries or projects. Or, make breaking minimal.

Non Goal:

This PR won't provide 100% typing precision or use case coverage. Such typing would be too prohibitive for both maintainers and users to reason.
Checking errors in JS isn't kept in mind. So changing existing JS to TS will cause errors.

Known limitations:

new Vue() wouldn't return a type with props type. This is caused by compiler limitations.
Props typing uses a hacky trick.
returning properties on this might trigger cyclic error, manual annotation is needed.
Prop type's union type declaration like oneProp: [String, User] might not work without manual annotation.

Next step:
Since we already has a canonical Vue API in TS, next we can ship tsx support in the official repo.",10,17

When mentioning certain library names like vueify and vue-loader, the documentation uses backticks in some places but not in others.  Of the cases I noticed, most were in links.  GitHub permits backticks within links and they are rendered with the fixed-width fontQ
The main README.md omits them for vue-loader.  To show the difference, I took the specific line from the table and included both forms:

An out-in transition could get stuck if the child with v-if was not yet shown and then replaced with a different child. In this case, ""afterLeave"" would never get fired, thus ""_leaving"" stayed true indefinitely. This was likely to happen with vue-router and asynchronous data loading before the new page is shown.
Fixes #6687.",4,8

As the docs says:

Properties that start with _ or $ will not be proxied on the Vue instance because they may conflict with Vue’s internal properties and API methods. You will have to access them as vm.$data._property.`

But, this is a little bit hidden during development. It would be better if a warn could be raised to show developer that the data property will not be proxied on the Vue instance.",2,5

Other information:
Component is too restrictive about props type: it either accepts an array or an object, but not both. This makes it illegal to assign CompoenntOptions to Component. Actually it is a typing bug, but it requires TS 2.6 to find this out.
So this pull request also bumps the compiler version. It only affects development.
Bumping version also finds another method naming problem in directive test :)
