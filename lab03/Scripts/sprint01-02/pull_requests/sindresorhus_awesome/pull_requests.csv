Information Retrieval and Web Search is a field which involves finding relevant information for a given query, be it for as simple as a database search, or as complicated as a web search (Eg - Google, Bing, Yahoo). There has been renewed interest in this field, thanks to Deep Learning and Vector Space Modeling. Finding content that is both relevant to the user, and has high topic relevance is the key point of research in this field. However, many don't know about the different resources available at out disposal. It would be a good idea to have a list of Awesome Information Retrieval and Web Search, for people to discover resources and make this field even more awesome.

[Explain what this list is about and why it should be included here]
I maintain a list of cryptography papers for normal human beings who have to implement, use and rely on cryptography in their work and would like to understand things better without getting second PhD. Crypto theory is huge chunk of reading, and part of my job is focusing fellow engineers on reading important practical things to give them theoretical and real-world context in their work. I believe this work will be useful for many other engineers, having to implement or use encryption and trying to understand better which things they should do and which they shouldn't.

This is a curated list of all the awesome projects, applications, research, tutorials, courses and books that use the open source H2O distributed machine learning platform.

We curate this list, so it's not simply a list of all the H2O content we find -- it's just the awesome stuff.
It is also not just a list of our own tutorials & content (that's listed somewhere else), this is a list of entirely community created works that we find on the web.
The ""Awesome H2O"" list has been around almost a year, so by now there's a decent amount of content on there and we feel it's ready to be included in the Awesome list.
The list items do not follow the suggested - [Fish](…) - User-friendly shell. format because the content items (blog post titles, research paper titles, book titles) usually have long, self-descriptive names.  Instead hyperlinked the title and used a internally self-consistent format to put dates after blog post titles, years after books titles, and authors associated with research papers, looking here for inspiration.

Per new requirements, I've reviewed #1320 and #1350.
This list contains resources relevant to the FIRST Robotics Competition, a global Robotics challenge for High School students. There are about 4,500 teams worldwide, each with at least a couple programmers (sometimes up to 20 or 30) so I think the interest is there.
I need to note that another user submitted this repository for consideration in #798 around a year ago. That user was given suggestions on how to improve the list, however he did not follow up on the suggestions and the pull request was closed.
I have spent some time going through the list, trimming low quality resources, and ensuring the markup adheres to the quality standards required for admission onto the main Awesome list. Furthermore, I have resolved all issues which were put forward by @sindresorhus in the initial pull request.
If you still do not want awesome-frc to be added that is understandable -- @sindresorhus did say the chance had been lost to be included in the Awesome list. However, I hope that since the project has been taken over by new authors, and your suggestions applied, we can get new consideration for inclusion.
I will commit to making any improvements deemed necessary by maintainers. I wholeheartedly apologize on behalf of the FRC community for getting off on the wrong foot.
Thank you to the Awesome maintainers for your guidance in this process.
