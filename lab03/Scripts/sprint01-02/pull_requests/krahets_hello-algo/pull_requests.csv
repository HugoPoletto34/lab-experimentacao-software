✅ 已通过测试用例
所有数组约定长度为 5。原因如下：
在 goalng 中，必须声明数组的长度，例如：nums := [5]int{1,2,3,4,5}。如果不声明长度，则被称为切片。
使用的注释没有按照 golang 的编程惯例，而是倾向于使用文档上下文的注释约定。

/* 初始化堆 */
// 初始化小顶堆

const maxHeap = new Heap(Heap.maxComparator);

maxHeap.push(3);
maxHeap.push(2);
maxHeap.push(5);
maxHeap.push(4);

/* 获取堆顶元素 */
let peek = maxHeap.peek(); // 5

/* 堆顶元素出堆 */

peek = maxHeap.poll(); // 5
peek = maxHeap.poll(); // 4
peek = maxHeap.poll(); // 3
peek = maxHeap.poll(); // 2

const size = maxHeap.size();

/* 判断堆是否为空 */
const isEmpty = maxHeap.isEmpty();

/* 输入列表并建堆 */
