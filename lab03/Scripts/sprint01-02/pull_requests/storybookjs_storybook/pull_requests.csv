This pull request updates all your dependencies to their latest version. Having them all up to date really is the best starting point. I will look out for further dependency updates and make sure to handle them in isolation and in real-time, as soon as you merge this pull request.
I won‚Äôt start sending you further updates, unless you have merged this very pull request.


üí• This branch failed. How to proceed
I suggest you find out what dependency update is causing the problem. Adapt your code so things are working nicely together again. [next-update](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-update) is a really handy tool to help you with this.
Push the changes to this branch and merge it.


üè∑ How to check the status of this repository
There is a badge added to your README, indicating the status of this repository.
This is how your badge looks like üëâ  


üë©‚Äçüíª How to update this pull request
# change into your repository‚Äôs directory
git fetch
git checkout greenkeeper/initial
npm install-test
# adapt your code, so it‚Äôs working again
git commit -m 'chore: adapt code to updated dependencies'
git push origin greenkeeper/initial


üôà How to ignore certain dependencies
In case you can not, or do not want to update a certain dependency right now, you can of course just change the package.json file back to your liking.
Add a greenkeeper.ignore field to your package.json, containing a list of dependencies you don‚Äôt want to update right now.
// package.json
{
  ‚Ä¶
  ""greenkeeper"": {
    ""ignore"": [
      ""package-names"",
      ""you-want-me-to-ignore""
    ]
  }
}


‚ú® How the updates will look like
As soon as you merge this pull request I‚Äôll create a branch for every dependency update, with the new version applied. The branch creation should trigger your testing services to check the new version. Using the results of these tests I‚Äôll try to open meaningful and helpful pull requests and issues, so your dependencies remain working and up-to-date.
-  ""underscore"": ""^1.6.0""
+  ""underscore"": ""^1.7.0""
In the above example you can see an in-range update. 1.7.0 is included in the old ^1.6.0 range, because of the caret ^ character .
When the test services report success I‚Äôll delete the branch again, because no action needs to be taken ‚Äì everything is fine.
When there is a failure however, I‚Äôll create an issue so you know about the problem immediately.
This way every single version update of your dependencies will either continue to work with your project, or you‚Äôll get to know of potential problems immediately.
-  ""lodash"": ""^3.0.0""
+  ""lodash"": ""^4.0.0""
In this example the new version 4.0.0 is not included in the old ^3.0.0 range.
For version updates like these ‚Äì let‚Äôs call them ‚Äúout of range‚Äù updates ‚Äì you‚Äôll receive a pull request.
Now you no longer need to check for exciting new versions by hand ‚Äì I‚Äôll just let you know automatically.
And the pull request will not only serve as a reminder to update. In case it passes your decent test suite that‚Äôs a strong reason to merge right away

Create mobile navigation that will apply when the screen is less than 650px

Introduction of a Collapsible / Accordion component that expands and focuses on the content area. The content should also be expanded when filtering.
Increased a11y of the menus by adding href to the anchor tags, this allows them to be keyboard focusable, specifically when tabbing through the interface.

UX note
I increased the font size of filter input from 14px to 1em (equivalent of 16px). Without this it would cause an unwanted page zoom when focused on the input. I've adjusted the appropriate height and close button styles to reflect appropriately.

For a future PR would there be any interest in moving to styled-components, glamorous, jsxstyle, fela, etc? Working with purely inline styles is fairly limiting.

Issue:
The idea is that early on in a project, when things are changing a lot, snapshot tests are not particularly useful, but it's still helpful to ""smoke test"" all stories to ensure they run without error.
What I did
I added a noMatchSnapshots option to just setup a test that runs each story, without checking snapshots.
How to test

Create a project, install storyshots but pass initStoryshots({ noMatchSnapshots: true }).
Add a story, run jest. Should pass.
Change the component's output, run jest again. Should still pass
Make the component error in the render function, run jest again. Should fail.

Notes:
Perhaps it would make sense to just allow passing a custom test function, to cover off cases like this and storybook-eol/storyshots#76? Then storyshots is more of a generic tool to integrate storybook with Jest.
initStoryshots({
  test(renderedStory) {
     // In my case, just render without looking at the result
     renderer.create(renderedStory).toJSON()

At this moment we can only use keyboard shortcuts and query string to get core functionalities. In some cases, we'd like to do the same via mouse or touch screen. Especially necessary for access from mobile devices
What I did
1. Added menu duplicate keyboard shortcuts to the left (stories) panel


expanded menu





  This menu is collapsible (default state):





  This menu has buttons to navigate within stories / storyKinds


We'll need it in Fullscreen mode



 Removed `‚åò` button from the header of left panel


It's still available from the core menu

2. Added floating menu when left panel is hidden


 Fullscreen mode


So we can navigate via mouse/touchscreen or return to the normal view



 Hidden left panel





 Expanse direction


Depending on its position menu expands to up or down direction

3. Mantra modules API


jumpToKind - new API to jump between storyKinds: modules/api/actions


floatingBoxOptions - settings of floating menu displaying. Default:


floatingBoxOptions: { 
      showFloatingBox: true, 
      floatingBoxPosition: boxPositions.BOTTOM_LEFT, 
}
4. Added tests for new components
How to test


Open demo page to test usability. Try it with mobile devices.


Clone repo


cd packages/storybook-ui
npm link
cd sample_repo
npm link @kadira/storybook-ui
npm start storybook
Try to use new menu to hide/show left/down panels. Go to fullscreen/normal mode. Navigate through the stories.
To change floating menu position set default settings to one of this

Run tests

cd storybook
npm run test
All tests should pass

Fixing performance issues
Added timestamps to setKnobs event.
If user is typing, his typing shouldn't be interrupted by randomly happening setKnobs action. Now setKnobs will actually do something only after user finishes typing.
Example
const {withKnobsOptions} = require('storybook-addon-knobs');
story.addDecorator(withKnobsOptions({timestamps: true}));

Added ability to pass debounce option when adding decorator
As #92 said we needed an option to add debouncing to knob changes.
I added an option to pass options when adding decorator to story.
Example
const {withKnobsOptions} = require('storybook-addon-knobs');
//debounce options are wait and leading, same as in lodash.
story.addDecorator(withKnobsOptions({debounce: { wait: 100, leading: true}}));

Difference between these two updates
The first update timestamps solves issues that happen when developing locally, since sometimes setKnobs happened after user has already started typing and it reverted the typing.
The debounce is useful if you are using knobs over the air, in device or in separate server, it simply doesn't send so many requests.
Of course you can use both at the same time:
const {withKnobsOptions} = require('storybook-addon-knobs');
//debounce options are wait and leading, same as in lodash.
story.addDecorator(withKnobsOptions({
    debounce: { wait: 100, leading: true},
    timestamps: true
}));

Things to note

Added loadash.debounce package as a dependency.
Two tests changed, added timestamps so they would work.

Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

üí• Breaking Change


#807 Change exit codes for updated and publish. (@koddsson)
It is now possible to run lerna publish in CI unconditionally, only publishing when changes are actually detected, and never failing when it decides to not publish anything.
Previously:

lerna publish when there are no updates to publish would throw an error
lerna updated when there are no updates would exit 0, making it ineffective as a chained filter (e.g., lerna updated && lerna publish)

Now:

lerna publish when there are no updates is a no-op, exiting successfully with a helpful log message
lerna updated when there are no updates will exit non-zero (but not throw an error), enabling it to be an effective filter



üöÄ Enhancement


#726 Add --only-updated option to exec and run subcommands. (@jameslnewell)
When executing a script or command, only run the script or command on packages that have been updated since the last release. A package is considered ""updated"" using the same rules as lerna updated.
lerna exec --only-updated -- ls -la
lerna run --only-updated test


#795 Add --parallel flag to lerna exec. (@evocateur)
With this flag, lerna exec will run the command in all filtered packages
in parallel, completely ignoring concurrency and topological sorting.
# transpile modules in all packages as changes occur
lerna exec -- babel src -d lib -w
# transpile watched modules only in package-foo
lerna exec --scope package-foo -- babel src -d lib -w
It is advised to constrain the scope of the command when running with this
flag, as spawning dozens of subprocesses may be harmful to your shell's
equanimity (or maximum file descriptor limit, for example). YMMV


#796 Add --parallel flag to lerna run. (@evocateur)
This allows simpler invocation of watch scripts, with the caveat that concurrency and topological sorting are completely ignored. This is generally the intention when calling lerna run watch and other similar script targets, hence the additional flag.
# the following commands are equivalent
lerna run watch --concurrency=1000 --stream
lerna run watch --parallel
Package filtering (--scope and --ignore) is still available when this new flag is being used, and it is advised to narrow the scope of parallel execution when you have more than a dozen packages or so (YMMV).


#803 Skip git repo check by default in Commands which do not rely on git. (@noherczeg)


#824 Add json output to ls and updated commands. (@ricky)
When run with --json, lerna updated and lerna ls will return an array of objects in the following format:
[
  {
    ""name"": ""package"",
    ""version"": ""1.0.0"",
    ""private"": false
  }
]

What I did
Looking at issue 1114 (#1114)...
The error came from a package called markdown-to-react-components. Looking at this package's github (https://github.com/christianalfoni/markdown-to-react-components) it's clear that the package is deprecated. They recommend using marksy (https://github.com/cerebral/marksy).
Marksy appears to be a fork of markdown-to-react-components because the APIs are almost identical (namely, the configuration is exactly the same). This made swapping out the old version for the new one very easy, which is what I did. I also updated the name of the config (which can be passed as an argument to this addon) to reflect the new underlying mechanism.

I tried it out and could knobs ""work"" (only updating values no reset etc) with a decorator.
I think that's pretty cool, and we should maybe add it to the api somehow as a good practice pattern.
My opinion is that with such an approach. We can lift the refreshing need etc in the api and let user use our addons without too much thinking.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of lint-staged.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

  .add('Two', ...)
  .add('Three', ...)

storiesOf('web.component.Link', module)
  .add('One', ...)
  .add('Two', ...)

The left panel will be like this:
web
|  component
|  |  Button
|  |      One    <-- if this is selected, other components are collapsed
|  |      Two
|  |      Three

What I did
1. Add new mantra module to @storybook/ui (src/modules/theming/) to provide theming API:

selectTheme(themeName: string) selects the current theme
getTheme(): object returns current theme object
getThemesList(): arrayOf(strings) returns names of loaded themes
setTheme(theme: object) adds new or updates existing theme

2. Add public API defaultState.uiOptions.currentTheme to @storybook/ui
available as:
import { setOptions } from '@storybook/addon-options';

setOptions({currentTheme: 'default'});
3. Consolidate all UI colors style settings in src/modules/theming/themes
default.js - the current UI style (not changed)
dark.js - dark UI style (the new one)
4. Pass theme data to all UI components via react-komposer (src/modules/ui/libs/gen_podda_loader.js). So it updates automatically on any change. UI Components can access it as a theme prop.
5. Make all style... objects depend on the theme data
6. Create ""Dark"" theme, while ""Default"" theme keeps current appearance.
How to test
1. Github pages: https://usulpro.github.io/storybook-themable
(here is an example of dynamic theme switching. We can use setOptions¬†in the config.js as well)
2. Checkout theming-support-#428 branch and:
$ npm install
$ npm run bootstrap
$ cd examples/cra-kitchen-sink
$ npm run storybook
you can set currentTheme by setOptions({currentTheme: 'dark'});
3. In order to test mantra module API you can do follow steps:

uncomment the line in src/modules/theming/index.js

console.log('UI API:', _actions);

in chrome console: right click on 'UI API:' and 'Store as GlobalVariable'
api = temp1;
api.theming.getTheme();
api.theming.selectTheme('dark');
newTheme = api.theming.getTheme();
newTheme.name = 'new';
api.theming.setTheme(newTheme);
api.theming.getThemesList();
api.theming.selectTheme('new');
newTheme.palette.canvas = 'green';
newTheme.palette.background = 'darkgreen';

What next
The aim of this PR is mainly to provide the API for theming support and pass (UI library agnostic) theme data to UI components. By adding this we're stepping towards to:

creation new built-in themes or improving existing ones
rethink what styles/data should be included in theme objects
provide a pluggable way to add new custom themes",7,13

Secondly, adding a __VUE_DEVTOOLS_CONTEXT__ variable and defining it as the iframe document, allows the devtools to properly walk the context and identify components. To work, this requires a change to Vue Devtools as well.
How to test

I created a prototype of an idea I had while last working with Storybook on a React Native project. As it stands, you currently need to have the simulator/emulator open to preview each scene and the browser open for the main UI. This has a few issues:

It's not very intuitive when first starting up. I worked on #1142 to help with this.
Having two windows open is a little bit annoying when switching between them.
Most of the browser UI is just wasted space for React Native projects.

To solve this issue, I propose moving the story picker (and potentially the addon panels) into the simulator. You would then be able to run Storybook inside an iPad or Android Tablet simulator and not have to worry about the browser UI.
Prototype Implementation
I don't expect this pull request to be merged in, it is intended to be the beginning of a discussion about the feature.
In this implementation, I have modified the existing React Native preview code to include a StoryListView this is linked together to the Preview class using the existing EventEmitter and store. I have made some small modifications to the events to wire everything together, but this is a very rough and ready solution (see below for the considerations I can think of).
These changes end up looking like this with an iPhone simulator in landscape:

(The slowness is the gif, not the implementation)
The idea is to expand this so the preview area on the right can be sized and the three different iPhone sizes and orientations for testing components on the different sized screen. With the resizable simulator, it might even be possible to include the iPad resolutions using a super-high-res simulator (I'm not certain that that is possible).
Discussions which need to happen
I think this is a path that should be explored for React Native as it vastly improves the developer experience. There are, however, some questions which would need to be addressed:

What is the best way to structure this? Do we modify the existing app/react-native/ module and detect when we are displaying on an iPad to enable this behaviour, or do we create an entirely new module which developers opt-in to using?
Is it possible to share code between the existing storybook-ui module and a possible React Native implementation? Would we need to start again, or is it possible to reuse some of the existing state management? Do we even need to share any of this?
What do we do about addons? I presume those that render into the panels are expecting a DOM environment and it won't be easy to make them cross-platform compatible? Do we just make native alternatives?
Do you even think that is is a good idea?",6,21

The goal is to allow new react-native versions without having to maintain an upper bounded version in Storybook.
What I did
Updates Storyboard's react-native module to allow any versions >=0.27.0, rather than keeping a capped upper-bound. As described in #1418 (comment), if a breaking change is later introduced the next version of storyboard can set the new minimum version. This removes the need to maintain an upper bound every time react-native rotates out a new release. I personally think it's okay to be a little less strict here.
Note: we cannot use ^0.27.0 since this is a prerelease, which will not be satisfied by semver

üòÆ Problem
Let's assume you use react@16.x.y(-alpha-z) and you write a story as similar as this one:
storiesOf('Fiber rendering', module)
  .add('with array', () => 
    ['Hello Button', 'üòÄ üòé üëç üíØ'].map(label => 
      <Button onClick={action(`clicked(${label})`)} key={label}>{label}</Button>
    )
  )
  .add('with string', () => 'Yay!')
  .add('with number', () => 1337)
  .add('with invalid render (object)', () => ({ invalid: true }));
In the React preview
There is a specific check on the element to render in the preview which prevents using the new ""rendering features"" of React Fiber:  array, string, number.
If you write a story as similar as the one shown above, the UI will throw errors as seen in this screencast.
In Storyshots (-> Jest -> Node)
requestAnimationFrame is used in React Fiber, and doesn't exist in Node env, and so Jest (storyshots). It appears that it's something that needs to be fixed at the whole app level, it's not only a Storyshots issue. See screenshot.
‚úçÔ∏è What I did
on the UI
Simply remove the check, and let ReactDOM throws an error if the element is invalid.
Here is a screencast of what's happening without this check:
Without the element.type === undefined check:

for Storyshots (/ Jest)
If somebody decides to use React Fiber and Jest, they needs to manually mock requestAnimationFrame (at the moment! ü§ô).
We can do like explained in this comment: facebook/react#9102 (comment).
// __mocks__/react.js
global.window = global;
window.addEventListener = () => {};
window.requestAnimationFrame = () => {
  throw new Error('requestAnimationFrame is not supported in Node');
};
üìü How to test
Setup using the examples/test-cra app
git clone https://github.com/storybooks/storybook
cd storybook
git checkout 724-react-fiber-support
cd examples/test-cra
yarn add react@alpha react-dom@alpha
yarn add --dev react-test-renderer@alpha
Add the following story to stories/index.js:
storiesOf('Fiber rendering', module)
  .add('with array', () => 
    ['Hello Button', 'üòÄ üòé üëç üíØ'].map(label => 
      <Button onClick={action(`clicked(${label})`)} key={label}>{label}</Button>
    )
  )
  .add('with string', () => 'Yay!')
  .add('with number', () => 1337)
  .add('with invalid render (object)', () => ({ invalid: true }));
Preview test
yarn storybook
Then, go to http://localhost:9009.

window.requestAnimationFrame = () => {
  throw new Error('requestAnimationFrame is not supported in Node');
};

Breaking change
Issue:
Using knobs is currently confusing.
Example, for complex strings and null values
select('My Select', {
  none: null, // renders empty item
  [`Computed key`]: 'computed', 
  'Some kind of long sentence. This is ok, mainly just looks odd as a key': 'sentence',
})

What I did
Use value as value
Still uses key for the key property on each <option>
How to test
select('My Select', {
  Empty: null,
  'First item': 'The first item selected',
  second: `The item with key 'second' is selected`
})

Will add some tests. Is there a preference between __tests__ folder and *.test.js?",6,14

What I did
JSX elements within prop values are now rendered completely (in Story Source and Prop Table). The behaviour can be reverted by configuring showSourceOfProps: false.
This yields some errors in the source code generation (with indentation).
I think it would be easier to do the JSX source generation outside of React components since there are a lot of ""inverted"" dependencies. Rendering the parent depends often on whether the child has multiple lines of code or just a single one.
There is some paddingLeft used for indentation  currently what breaks copy & paste behaviour. I think some of the issues outlined could be fixed by using paddingLeft in some cases but I'd rather not do that (because copy & paste).
Would you be open to a diffrent approach on rendering the source code?

How to test
Create a story with a property value of type JSX element.
  .addWithInfo('Test', () => {
    const Test = ({ foo, bar, children, arr }) => (<div>
      <div>{foo}</div>
      <div>{bar}</div>

      foo: PropTypes.node.isRequired,

#766 and other discussions

We want to apply not only one addon for a story
Addons like .addWithX don't allow addons composition

What we have at this moment:

We started to move from addons like .addWithX to addons like withX()

withX() in general has such API:
withX(...props) { /* return storyFn(context) => <Story /> */ }
At this moment we have withInfo and addonNotes.  And we can compose them this way:
.add('addons composition',
    withInfo('with info')(addonNotes({ notes: 'with notes' })(() => <button>click me</button>))
)
It's much better but we still have issues with this:
a. It looks like a kind of ""callbacks hell"" when we need to compose several addons
b.  withX() should have such structure:
const withX = (...props) => {
  return getStory => (context) => {
    return getStory(context);
  };
};

We have current API for .add()

storiesOf(...)
  .add(name, (context) => <Story />)
where context is an object: { story, kind }. Usually, we omit context: add(name, () => <Story />)
and decorators API is:
storiesOf(...)
  .addDecorator((storyFn, context) => { /* return storyFn(context) */ })
What we want:


Convenient and flexible way for applying addons


Easy approach for creating new addons


Proposal:

Use this way for addons applying:

storiesOf('Button', module)
  .add('with addons', context =>
    context
      .storyOf(<Button>Press me</Button>)
      .withBorder('red')
      .withNotes('Addons composition')
      .withInfo('Addons composition', { inline: false })
  )
  .add('single story', () => <Button>Hello Button</Button>)
It shouldn't break the existing API and should be backward compatible.
Actually, this approach still keeps the same API:
storiesOf(...)
  .add(name, (context) => <Story />)

Start creating addons functions with such structure:

const withX = (storyFn, context, ...props) => { /* return storyFn(context) */ }
Here withX just returns new component and do some side effects.

Possibly we don't want to expand storybook API surface and change Storybook code as well ;-)

What I did:
I just created an addon to implement this behavior! :)
It works this way:
// config.js
import { configure, setAddon } from '@storybook/react';
import getAddons from './addon-composition';

setAddon(getAddons);
// stories.js
import { withInfo } from '@storybook/addon-info';
import { withNotes } from '@storybook/addon-notes';

// Let's create a simple addon as an example:
const withBorder = (storyFn, context, bcolor) =>
  // the first two arguments should be storyFn and context
  <div style={{ padding: 6, border: `${bcolor} solid 2px` }}>
    {storyFn()}
  </div>;

storiesOf('Button', module)
  .getAddons(withInfo, withNotes, withBorder) // <-- pass addons we want to use
  .add('with addons', context =>
    context
      .storyOf(<Button>Press me!</Button>) // <-- the story and addons below:
      .withNotes('Addons composition')
      .withBorder('red')
      .withInfo('Addons composition', { inline: false })
  )
  .add('with text', () => <Button>Hello Button</Button>) // <-- usual stories
  .add('with some emoji', () => <Button>üòÄ üòé üëç üíØ</Button>)
In this example we create a <Button> and applying addon in the following order:

withNotes
withBorder
withInfo

We can add normal stories to the same storiesOf - they will work as usual
The pros of this approach


It's backward compatible with existing API


Easy to compose addons, change addons order, disable/enable addons.


Addons with such structure could be easily turned to decorators:


storiesOf('Button', module)
  .addDecorator((storyFn, context) => withX(storyFn, context, ...props))

We can create a composition of not only addons but stories as well. For that we can pass a function to context.storyOf it will be invoked with an argument prevStory - the result of previous execution of context.storyOf:

storiesOf('Button', module)
  .getAddons(withInfo, withNotes, withBorder)
  .add('with addons', context =>
    context
      .storyOf(<Button>Press me!</Button>)
      .withJSX() 
      .storyOf(prevStory => 
        <div> 
          Press this button: 
          {prevStory} 
        </div> 
      ) 
In this example withJSX() shows details of <Button> while we see the button wrapped into div. Even if withJSX() change the story somehow, prevStory will be the clean value passed directly from previous storyOf. I guess it's a quite unusual feature and may be discussed in a separate issue.
How to test
Run cra-kitchen-sink
Play with the example:

change an order of addons
put addons to decorators
write your own addon :)

src of addon:
examples/cra-kitchen-sink/.storybook/addon-composition.js
example:
examples/cra-kitchen-sink/src/stories/index.js
Additional
I guess one point could confuse in this addon implementation:
storiesOf('Button', module)
  .getAddons(withInfo, withNotes, withBorder) // <--
if we don't want to do it for every storiesOf maybe more convinient could be to do it ones in config.js:
// config.js
import { configure, setAddon } from '@storybook/react';
import { withInfo } from '@storybook/addon-info';
import { withNotes } from '@storybook/addon-notes';
import getAddons from './addon-composition';

setAddon(getAddons(withInfo, withNotes)); // <--
but for that, we need a feature in setAddon API to execute a function when storiesOf is creating (something like 'constructor' for classes). This feature is introduced in this PR: #1463",7,11

make withX signatures consistent
make string-only variant of withNotes/withInfo
simplify withInfo code

I have documented the rationale behind this change here:

Will obviously put this into a more permanent place in the docs if we converge on this convention and migrate things over to it.

What I did
Modified the styles for the OnDeviceMenu to make the menu something you can show/hide instead of always taking up the space.
NOTES

Right now it is not ""fancy"" meaning no animation or anything. I plan on adding that likely in a commit within the next 24 hours.
Instead of un-mounting the menu like I originally planned I had to simply move it off screen as the mount/unmount causes issues with resetting which story you are looking at. This could probably be solved so you could unmount however since I plan on animating it I will need it to sit off screen anyway... so lets call it ""planning for the future""
I found that a method call in the StoryListView was incorrect when cleaning up listeners. I fixed that.
Right now the trigger for opening/closing the menu is just text. We probably will want something better.

In short, React Fiber deprecated the ability to add ref to a stateless function component.
What I did
Converted LeftPanel and Shortcuts from stateless function components to React.Components.
It should be said that it seems the documentations of developing storybook slightly outdated and missing some information.
Another thing to mention is that I had to use eslint-disable for the components since according to some ESLint React plugin rule they shouldn't be a regular React.Component.
I hope I did an okay fix. Please, let me know.
How to test

clone the repo with fix
run npm install
run npm link
go to lib/ui and run there npm link
go to app/react and over there do the following:
run npm i react@next react-dom@next --only=dev
run `npm link '@storybook/ui'
run npm link

After the flowing you should create a React project using React Fiber.
Needs over there to set-up storybook and then run npm link '@storybook/react'.

What I did
Swapped out SectionList for ListView. This will be deprecated in the future (I don't believe anytime soon/immediate), so ideally we may want to export a List component that interfaces with whichever underlying ListView / SectionList implementation is supported. For now, this simply unbreaks <0.43 builds.
There are two additional regressions: StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject and the use of maxWidth in a style. For ease of use moving forward, I added a polyfills/ directory to address these head on.
StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject
This is only supported in recent versions. It's simply a preset style for a full screen absolutely positioned element.
MinMaxViewPolyfill
The min/max width/height features of styles are not available on earlier versions of React Native. This adds a Higher Order Component that can declaratively (through props) apply these bounding rules to any child component.

Run the react-native-vanilla project and verify all continues to work.

I've added only those bootsrappers, lack of which produced issues for me. Maybe it's worth to add some more (or remove bootstrap:docs)
The issues I faced are:

In, #1676, the only reason we can't promote import/extensions to ""error"" level is that packages highlight.js and fuse.js are treated by this rule as local files unless they're actually installed
In #1696, I have to add dependencies to eslint-plugin-flowtype, eslint-plugin-flowtype-errors, and flow-bin to root package instead of lib/components so that they're installed with simple yarn install without bootstrapping

What I did
I improved the 'running-tests'-experience by creating a inquirer script for running the test-suites.
How to test

Install
bootstrap
run yarn test >> should open an inquirer
run yarn test -- --watch >> should start default suites in watchmode
run yarn test -- --core --watch >> should start only core suite in watchmode
run yarn test -- --core --reactnative >> should start core & reactnative suites to completion

It's also possible to run yarn test -- -h to get a list of all options available.
Why
I like this because it makes it discoverable. It also allows contributors to focus on a subset of tests. This is useful in our codebase because changes to for example the react, vue or angular apps can not have any effect on their tests. So if your changes are solely on those parts of the codebase it makes little sense to have to bootstrap the react-native example(s) just to be able to run the unit tests.
I've set ALL the suites as default = true, so that includes the react-native suite! So it's an OPT-OUT to NOT run the tests for react-native. Feedback on this would be appreciated very much!
TODO

 update documentation
 change .circleci.yml

Is this testable with jest or storyshots?
Possibly, I'm hoping the reviewers will let me know if they think that would be sensible

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.
I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of eslint-plugin-jest.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Currently, latest-version is used to choose which versions of packages to install. This means that new packages and features can be used in CLI templates only after becoming stable. This PR changes it so that @storybook/cli@3.3.0-alpha.1 adds ""@storybook/*"": ""^3.3.0-alpha.1"", which is future-compatible meaning that versions like 3.11.10 will still match this mask. This, for example, makes it possible to run smoke-tests (introduced in 3.3) when testing CLI
Promise rejections are unhandled unless you explicitly add a catch line. See #1474 (comment). Here I switch it to a single handler on top level
CLI tests don't test current versions of packages but install them from npm (related to 1.). I included lib/cli/test/run/* to yarn workspaces, so that after running getstorybook in all the fixtures directories, a single yarn command can install all the needed dependencies and link local @storybook/* packages.

This is a small tweak to the new multiSnapshotWithOptions test function.

I've added a functionality to the docs-v2 build script that will commit a new exported docs version to a separate repo
Tasks TBD

 Fix relative to root links
 Fix dynamic chunks are not being downloaded for the version site.
 Use/Create Storybook bot user to commit to the docs repo.
 Create storybook docs repo
 Add the docs repo to the CI
 Add DOCS_REPO variable with access token to CI
 Automate docs deployment in main storybook CI
 Generate the versions.json for a versions drop-down
 Fix edge case when the same exported version is generated with a different build hash (because maybe something was changed but version is still the same) : when copying to the main _next dir the old app version data should be deleted.

Create a repo

Run the build script from the step 4
Change the version in the docs-v2/package.json

When a fatal webpack error occurs (e.g. wrong configuration) storybook's error handler incorrectly assumes that the stats object is provided by webpack. See https://webpack.js.org/api/node/#error-handling for details on error handling.
The effect is the callback throwing an exception at https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/blob/master/app/react/src/server/build.js#L86, with a message to the effect of 'undefined has no property hasErrors'.
This is a problem because some webpack loaders will run timers or open sockets that prevent the node process from exiting, and when the callback throws an error before reaching the process.exit(1); code which would kill it.
There have been cases where in continuous integration environments the build will run indefinitely (which is a problem when you pay per-second).

Added a simple check to ensure stats is passed, before using it.

The --exec parameter of nodemon used single quotes instead of double quotes.

I added a prepare-root script which builds the parent package, added that as an initial command to the dev script.

This integrates into the yarn test workflow, and in fact is a jest project you can toggle on and off.
As a developer it's possible to just run all test in watch-mode all at once.
In the CI it's possible run all test or projects separately to get fine-grained feedback what's broken without having to look into the logs.
What I did

Added a jest project for integration testing
Added a test for taking screenshots of a running example
Integrated this into CI task

How to test

yarn test --integration
change some implementation in cra or vue example that impacts welcome story significantly
yarn test --integration
should now fail and save diff screenshots
yarn test --integration --watch
press u to update, if implementation is correct

In certain configurations Storybook might log the whole Webpack
build object when warnings or errors are thrown. This was caused
by a logger.error call inside the index.js catch.
What I did
This fixes by logging the error only when it's an instance of an error.
How to test
This branch was tested on https://github.com/pagarme/pilot. Before
this changes, if an error happens while compiling (e.g. imported file not
found) a big object is logged:

This is a bot from https://probot.github.io/apps/stale/

Well I attempted to fix by updating angular and the angular-cli to latest versions, it seems to change the behavior, so it's worth a shot. Maybe this fixes things.
Also added a flag to the typescript compiler options to: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/What's-new-in-TypeScript#new---skiplibcheck
