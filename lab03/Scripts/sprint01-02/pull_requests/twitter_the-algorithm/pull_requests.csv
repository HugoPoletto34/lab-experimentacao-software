 The Twitter Recommendation Algorithm is a set of services and jobs that are responsible for constructing and serving the
 Home Timeline. For an introduction to how the algorithm works, please refer to our [engineering blog](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/open-source/2023/twitter-recommendation-algorithm). The

This pull request updates the README file for Navi, making several improvements to its structure and content.

This change should make it easier to find and access the file, especially for new users who are not familiar with the project's directory structure.
In addition to the structural changes, I have also made several improvements to the grammar and readability of the document. Specifically, I have corrected grammar mistakes and rephrased several sections for clarity. These changes should make the README more accessible and understandable for all users.
