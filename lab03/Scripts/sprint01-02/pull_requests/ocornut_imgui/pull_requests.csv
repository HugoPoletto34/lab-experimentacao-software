This adds a text_align parameter on the Selectable function and just passes that straight through to RenderTextClipped instead of the hard-coded (0, 0).

I chose to pass the _Input flags through the entire stack, letting each widget decide what to show based on the input data. This means that some paths are a little more expensive because HSV-to-RGB conversions are done more than once, but it also makes it much easier to make sure the whole Color family of functions is lossless.
All drag-and-dropped color data is still RGB; HSV colors are converted to RGB when you drag them, and RGB data is converted to HSV when you drop a color onto a widget with _InputHSV specified.
I didn't add anything to the demo, because it wasn't super clear to me that this was worth surfacing in the demo; it's more about enabling different backend representations than a frontend change. The only thing I could think of is showing both the RGB and HSV interpretations of the same ImVec4 with two different ColorEdits; is that worth including, or just confusing?
Known backwards-incompatible changes

ImGuiColorEditFlags__InputMask was renamed to ImGuiColorEditFlags__ShowMask, and ImGuiColorEditFlags__InputMask is now used for a different mask. Since this is internal this breakage should be fine.
ColorEdit4 used to let you specify more than one of ImGuiColorEditFlags_RGB, ImGuiColorEditFlags_HSV, and ImGuiColorEditFlags_HEX, but the behavior of the function was a little odd. It now asserts that only one of those flags is provided.

This change adds a new member to the ImGui_ImplVulkan_InitInfo struct which users of ImGui can set to the correct multisample level for their target frame buffer. The zero value (which you'll get by default if the struct has been zero-initialised) is not a valid MSAA level in Vulkan, so we detect that case and use VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT instead at setup time.

The docking code assumes a BGRA8Unorm pixel format, but that may not be correct. The correct format is pulled from the frame buffer description to prevent a crash.
The MetalContext initializer was losing references to renderPipelineStateCache and bufferCache for systems within an autorelease pool. The initializer now uses the property setters to ensure memory management is correct regardless of memory management scheme.

As we now load function pointers manually, it's possible for vkCmdBeginRenderingKHR and vkCmdEndRenderingKHR to be nullptr. Is it fine to just cause a segfault in ImGui_ImplVulkan_RenderWindow when UseDynamicRendering is enabled but the extension wasn't enabled on the device and the function pointers therefore possibly be nullptr?",7,42

I've made the initial commit specifically about the Wii U to open conversation about whether these changes can in fact be upstreamed and also if there's a better solution. The final result can likely generalize the checks to something that's non Wii U specific.
Context on changes:
We opt out of usages of alloca for that platform because that's not available in the build system for Wii U -- and we have one check to avoid clearing state flags. As we use our own backend to support the system, we use the state flags to open the keyboard where necessary but for some reason they're getting cleared here (is this an ImGui bug?).",3,5

Hitting ctrl+backspace with the cursor at the end of a buffer containing a command in the form cmd.shadows.enabled| will, after this change, result in cmd.shadows.| where previously the entire buffer would be cleared.
This change also introduces support for ctrl+delete, matching the behavior of ctrl+backspace but in the opposite direction. shift+delete still works to cut text with this change.
These are standard behaviors in all text editors, so this change makes InputText widgets better match what users' intuitions are.
In the following video you can see the effect of consecutively pressing ctrl+backspace, and then once again from the beginning with ctrl+delete:

This PR adds support for the two main (and only?) implementations of WebGPU that one can use when building native binary applications instead of wasm:

Dawn (Chrome's C++ backend)
wgpu-native (binding Firefox' Rust backend)

The header assumes that the following macros are defined:

WEBGPU_BACKEND_WGPU iff wgpu-native backend is used
WEBGPU_BACKEND_DAWN iff Dawn backend is used
If none of the above is defined, WEBGPU_BACKEND_EMSCRIPTEN is assumed

NB These macros are automatically defined in the WebGPU-binaries distributions (main branch uses wgpu-native, dawn branch uses Dawn) which are used in my LearnWebGPU for native C++ tutorial series. This gives the context in which I adapted this wgpu backend.
Notable changes

Switch to WGSL shaders instead of SPIR-V binary blobs
Add gamma correction when the target texture format requires it (ending with ""Srgb"")
Handle the Release methods, which are not specified in the standard webgpu.h header and have different names in the wgpu-native implem.
Align buffer sizes to 16 bytes",3,14
