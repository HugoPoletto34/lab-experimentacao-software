Sourced from ansi-regex's releases.

v5.0.1
Fixes (backport of 6.0.1 to v5)
This is a backport of the minor ReDos vulnerability in ansi-regex@<6.0.1, as requested in #38.

Fix ReDoS in certain cases (#37)
You are only really affected if you run the regex on untrusted user input in a server context, which it's very unlikely anyone is doing, since this regex is mainly used in command-line tools.

This PR is a current draft for a RedwoodJS Quickstart guide.
It is a work in progress, and will be followed up with an example repo that people can use.
Note. This example stays true to the other Quickstart guides, but is not typically how one would create a Redwood app.
It relies on all client web side interaction with Supabase for fetching profiles etc.
However, Prisma has some shortcomings that make this quick start impractical to do:

it cannot introspect or use cross schema foreign keys. That is the profile user id cannot link to the auth.users table.
RLS on the Redwood api side is not possible with Prisma because it cannot set the auth user's token in the transaction
While I could have rewritten the guide to use the Supabase client on the api side, still use GraphQL for profile fetching and mutation, this felt like more an exercise in learning Redwood that Supabase. Though, these should still be authored and added as ""advanced"" examples.

So, we'll just use Supabase from the web side, which is perfectly fine. This example still leverages Redwood's Supabase auth integration and all the useAuth() hooks for sign in/out and determining if your user is logged in.
And the token is still verified on the API side via the JWT_SECRET and the Supabase decoder.

OSS page and txt files such as humans.txt are returning 404. This PR will redirect those links to /doc/ where they are now located.
Related #3797
What is the current behavior?
OSS page and txt files return 404.
This is due to the following reasons:

txt files had rewrite rule set up in next.config.js, but since the rewrite path is not on the same next.js app, the rule was ignored, hence returning 404.
OSS page did not have any rewrite or redirect configurations on next.config.js

What is the new behavior?
When users try to access OSS page and txt files on the old URL, they will be redirected to /docs/ path.
