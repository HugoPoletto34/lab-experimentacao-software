To use it, you'll need Docker (on Linux, Mac or Windows). Then do:
$ docker build -t apollo-11 .

This is based on an Ubuntu 16.04 base image.

One question: How crucial is exact spacing in comments--e.g. in line 100 comment in the scan the ""= 2"" is one char to the left of the ""= 1"" of the preceding line, but in the code it is two chars to the right. So, to get the scan alignment would mean using five spaces instead of the final tab in the code.
