The classifier is trained on a set of known people, and can recognize people based on training set.
The k-nearest neighbors approach where distance is calculated in the face-encoding space should work well for large sets of known people. It uses sklearn's KNN classifier with a ball-tree implementation.
Also added option for visualization of the results.",3,2
