The Selenium FormFiller can be used to auto complete various online forms including google surveys, data entry, email response message boxes, and more. This tutorial I made will walk a user through the auto completion of a google online survey. The script assumes that a user already has the Senium library pre-installed and only minor edits need to be made for filling out a custom form other than the included example
Motivation and Context

There is currently a Selenium based example project which I used to learn about the Selenium Webdriver but there is little information in this project that helped me fulfill the purpose for why I needed Selenium: an auto form filler. I had to do the rest of the learning on my own and I wanted to share my results.

How Has This Been Tested?

Testing was performed on my personal Windows based environment and my personal Linux based enviroment running on an Ubuntu based VM. With a simple project addition like this, testing ran smoothly and indicated a successful implementation of the example project

Windows 11 base platform with Linux VM. Ran script side testing on both OS platforms. Testing was performed by evaluating the completion level of the Form Filler.

No other areas of the code are affected.
