make cov will now generate the report, display it, and save an HTML version.
make test already ensures that test dependencies are installed. This seemed clever and helpful for beginners, so I did the same for make tox-test and make cov. (Also, added tox and pytest-cov to test-requirements.txt)
Updated contribution guide to replace the py.test, tox, and coverage instructions with the make versions. Consistent/similar commands should be easier to remember? Also ensures everyone runs the same tests every time.

1936,2016-06-29T10:02:35Z,,2017-04-21T17:46:22Z,2,47,1,"I just had this bug on my application, let me give you this example:
class SingleObjectMixin(object):
    def get_object(self):
        # implementation detail

class ShowView(SingleObjectMixin, MethodView):
    def get(self):
        return self.render_response(obj=self.get_object())

class DeleteView(SingleObjectMixin, MethodView):
    def delete(self):
        orm.delete(self.get_object())
        return self.redirect_to_list()

class ShowDeleteView(ShowView, DeleteView):
    pass
Because the metaclass for MethodView defines a methods property on each view, inheriting from two MethodView doesn't combine the supported methods.
Right now you have to do:
class ShowDeleteView(ShowView, DeleteView):
    methods = ['GET', 'DELETE']
which is explicit, but which I think is not how MethodView was intended to work.
Of course this fix, does allows you to inherit from two MethodView and override the supported methods.",3,3

Perhaps a better solution would be to edit werkzeug directly and add it to that init (which, in turn, would allow us to remove the subclass init). I don't believe that would cause any unintended behavior, but I'm open to further conversation on it.

Inspired by mix phoenix.routes, this will display a list of all registered routes in an application. This is basically #1446, but I have updated it and made it ""dumber"".
NB: I know that the other PR is old and there doesn't seem to be much enthusiasm for it, but I do think this is useful to have to get a high level overview of application routes, especially if they are being generated programmatically.
