preview is to prevent editing the scene. Because scrolling the preview
does not have any interaction with the scene and its sources, you should
be able to still scroll around and look at different parts of your
preview while the preview is locked.
There is also a bugfix included for a small bug: previously, if you were
to right click while space bar was held down, you would be stuck in
scroll mode until spacebar is pressed/released again. This gets around
it by forcing scroll mode to end when a right click is issued on the

Features:

recording in 2.1, 4.0 quad, 5.1, 7.1, 8.0, 16.0 (mkv, ts, mp4)
streaming in same formats :
mpeg-ts (ffmpeg aac, opus) and rtmp (ffmpeg aac)
(exposed in the UI by additional audio settings,  most changes have been cosmetic because the code was already multichannel capable).
decklink input extended to 8.0 and 16.0 (e.g. audio embedded in SDI)
07/18/17: compatible streaming services: Twitch , FB 360 live

Possible uses for multichannel audio streaming:

feeding facebook live 360 with a 4.0 audio
(ambisonics of first order needs to be acquired and processed first,
by a DAW, check here)
[06/28/2017: confirmed to work by one of the FB developers]
multilingual streaming: the rtmp and mpeg-ts streams can be live  dumped and remuxed (e.g. by ffmpeg) into either mpeg-ts with several separate mono audio streams or into several rtmp streams
carrying a mono channel (this is my case use);
several HLS players (eg hls.js, jwplayer, videojs), mpeg-dash players (bitmovin, videojs, jwplayer) support live multiple audio renditions.
server side: wowza, Unified streaming support multiple audio ingest (mpeg-ts); most CDN also do.

Extensive testing for this PR was carried out :


by varying the multichannel format ( 7.1 5.1 etc), the recording method (simple recording, advanced standard recording, advanced custom ffmpeg recording to file), the file formats, the streaming protocols (rtmp, mpeg-ts), the streaming method (simple rtmp, advanced rtmp, advanced custom ffmpeg output to URL: rtmp or mpeg-ts), the audio codecs ( coreaudio aac, ffmepg aac, opus mostly, a little bit vorbis) , the input device (capture card [decklink] with various inputs [hdmi and sdi tested], or multichannel movie);


details here


Issues:

decklink cards swap several audio channels with respect with libav usage:
channel 3 <-> 4, 5 <->7, 6<-> 8
==> as a fix, I have expanded Mntone commit to have channel orders comply with libavutil;
(octagonal and hexadecagonal channel layouts 8.0 and 16.0 are however recognized without swapping issue)
coreaudio aac almost always misidentifies the channel order
==> not fixed, therefore prefer the use of ffmpeg aac which works all the time.
CoreAudio AAC works however for quad channels (FL FR BL BR).
2.1 does not work in simple output mode: one has to use ffmpeg aac in advanced mode.
opus can be picky about bitrates for certain multichannel setups (2.1 4.0); however it supports 16.0 8.0 6.0  in the tests I made while aac does not.

Edit 06/26/17:


PR updated with 8.0 and 16.0 capabilities useful for broadcast (SDI ingest) ; tested with mpeg-ts tcp with 16.0 source /libx264 + opus with mapping_family=255 option (required for general channel layouts beyond 7.1)

This pull request fixes the above problem.
Steps to reproduce:

Using a Linux computer which has more than one ALSA audio device detected by OBS (ie. more than one front: PCM listed by arecord -L), add the ""Audio Capture Device (ALSA)"" source to a scene. (Alternatively, on a computer with no front: PCMs at all.)
Right click the new source, choose ""Properties"", and show the ""Device"" dropdown.

Expected results:

OBS displays the ""Custom"" option, once, at the end of the list, as specified in #599.

Actual results:

OBS displays multiple ""Custom"" options (or none at all), one after every detected device.

(x264, enc-amf, nvenc, mac-vth264, quicksync, etc).
warning

For enc-amf, a flag signalling that dynamic bitrate must be added; I put this as a placeholder so that I don't forget to submit a PR to enc-amf submodule repo.  (see below update of 02/22)
for (old) nvenc, ffmpeg master git head is required since dynamic bitrate was added to nvenc ffmpeg only recently (05/05/18 ) through a patch I submitted.
new jim-nvenc supported. Works much better than previous nvenc. I routinely get zero frame drops.

What this does:

for rtmp streams, decrease the video bitrate when available bandwidth is going down until all packets go through;
increase the video bitrate once bandwidth conditions get better.

Some screenshots
(1) enable dynamic bitrate in Simple output

(2) Advanced settings for dynamic bitrate

(3) Bitrate decrease from 2500 kbs due to congestion (downward red arrow)

(4) Bitrate stationary during congestion (not increasing yet because congestion hasn't cleared, arrow is now orange and not red as in this screenshot, see discussion with Dodgepong)

(5) Bitrate increasing due to congestion clearing (upward green arrow (red in this screenshot))",15,47
