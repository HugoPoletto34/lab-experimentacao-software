I had one rather large problem with the use of pixel perfect as a recommendation. With the proliferation of mobile devices and constant drive upwards in screen density I feel as a highly recommended practice this should be actively discouraged.
Now more than ever we are building systems of components that work together within the constraints of this large device landscape. Having this on the list sends the wrong message that it's acceptable without the context of the whole system. We should actively discourage the workflow in favour of close collaboration and education with designers less familiar with our front-end challenges. Often small discrepancies between mock and prod are due to needed compromise and aim to make the design stronger / more maintainable in the long term.
Falling down the rabbit hole of pixel nudging at arbitrary resolutions will only compromise the overall integrity of a system.
Just my 2c, thanks again for the work you have put in here.",8,14

HTTPS is one of the most important things on the internet today. There is no legitimate reason that websites shouldn't be using HTTPS, especially with tools such as Let's Encrypt. Especially with Google Chrome's recent change to mark HTTP sites as ""Not Secure"" HTTPS is more important than ever, and there is no reason that websites shouldn't be using it. Therefor I believe HTTPS should be considered high priority instead of medium.

![Medium][medium_img] indicates that the item is highly recommended but can potentially be omitted in very specific cases. However, omitting these elements can negatively impact performance or SEO.
![High][high_img] indicates that the item cannot be omitted under any circumstances. Removing these elements may result in page malfunctions or cause accessibility and SEO issues. Testing should prioritize these elements first.",2,0
