If git diff matches on git, then /usr/bin/git diff should match also. Not matching on explicit paths:

+ Gives rule authors the ability to match only when an explicit path to the command is given
- Prevents rule authors from matching on a command regardless of what path was given (if any)

Since the default behavior for fuck is to require user interaction before confirming a command, casting a wider net is unlikely to be harmful.
Also, the only rule that uses @for_app and has a path in the match string that I could find, has the path there because the most common invocation of that tool uses a path and the rule doesn't work otherwise, because of this limitation. In other words, it seems that the only rule that uses a path in the for_app string does so as a work-around to this too-strict behavior. I can only speculate that other rules, including the rm_dir rule, may have avoided the decorator for this reason.
Rule authors should not have to enumerate all the different paths a command could be called from, in my view. Hopefully this has not been litigated previously.
Before accepting, consider my commit message to d30a789. It may be better to strip paths in both places, but I'm not sure. Also if you need more tests, let me know where and I'll be happy to add them.",2,0

I have updated the readme file. I have updated it with the following:

Warp up link: to help the readers warp to the top at any point of time whilst reading/referring readme. This will save their time and prevent over scrolling across the readme.
Contents section: to help readers refer to a particular section of the readme without scrolling.

The above-mentioned features do the following:

Improve readability.
Helps them keep a check of different sections present in the readme.
Looks more presentable.

Added a VSCode devcontainer to help people get up and running with the repo quicker without needing to install any tooling or do any setup of venv
