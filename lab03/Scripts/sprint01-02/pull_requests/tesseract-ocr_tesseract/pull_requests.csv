Reported by ettl.martin78, Feb 11, 2014
Please review the attached patch. It fixes a potential usage of an uninitialized bool variable ('fuzzy_sp'). The fix simply initialized the variable by default to 'FALSE'. Before the fix, the value of 'fuzzy_sp' was not set, but used in the else-branch in line 1107:
      else {
        prev_blanks = blanks;
        prev_fuzzy_sp = fuzzy_sp;
        prev_fuzzy_non = fuzzy_non;
      }

Best regards and many thanks

The updated patch fixes two more uninitialized variable usages in the same function.
Many thanks for reviewing.

This should be no-brainer. These functions never seemed to do anything useful. The only oddity was with alloc_string which rounded the allocation upwards to nearest multiple of 4. Based on my review of code, I could not identify any value in this feature, so even alloc_string was simply transformed to malloc.
memry.* are removed. All code is adjusted to simply call malloc and free instead.
listio.* are removed. The list reading function in these files appears to have been unused, and contained the only invocation of strsave define, which was one of the alloc_string users, so I removed both of them.

Specifically, test for the existence of either libtoolize or glibtoolize and caching its location into a script variable prior to running the utility in order to prevent either utility's invocation from spawning error messages of the form './autogen.sh: line $LINE: $COMMAND: command not found' (with the $LINE and $COMMAND pseudo-variables replaced with content relevant to what line the command that spawned this error message was on within autogen.sh and what command's invocation was attempted at that point, of course.)  In particular, this takes into account macOS's wonky libtool semantics, which involve the following idiosyncrasies:

The version of libtool that Apple bundles within both Xcode and its separate associated 'Command-Line Developer Tools' package comes without a copy of libtoolize.
macOS package managers like Homebrew and MacPorts typically install the GNU versions of libtool and libtoolize as glibtool and glibtoolize, respectively, when needed by another package as a dependency or otherwise requested by an end-user.

The pre-existing code which was supposed to handle this case was not resilient with respect to errors finding either the system copy or the GNU variant of libtoolize, as it ran both libtoolize and glibtoolize, in that order, without checking for the existence of either utility!  (From the man page of the copy of bash included with macOS 'El Capitan' v10.11.6, which is reported to be GNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin15) by bash --version:

SHELL GRAMMAR

…

   Lists
          A list is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by one of the operators ;, &, &&, or ||,  and optionally terminated by one of ;, &, or <newline>.

          Of  these  list  operators,  &&  and  || have equal precedence, followed by ; and &, which have equal precedence.

          A sequence of one or more newlines may appear in a list instead of a semicolon to delimit commands.

          If a command is terminated by the control operator &, the shell executes the  command  in  the  background in a subshell.  The shell does not wait for the command to finish, and the return status is 0.
          Commands separated by a ; are executed sequentially; the shell waits for each command to terminate in turn.  The return status is the exit status of the last command executed.

          The  control  operators  &&  and || denote AND lists and OR lists, respectively.  An AND list has the form

                 command1 && command2

          command2 is executed if, and only if, command1 returns an exit status of zero.

          An OR list has the form

                 command1 || command2

          command2 is executed if and only if command1 returns a non-zero exit status.  The  return  status  of AND and OR lists is the exit status of the last command executed in the list.

…


— note, however, that this text only implies that execution of the second command in the || list can be short-circuited if the execution of the first command fails; that first command is always executed!)
This root cause of this issue was initially clarified to me by the second half of this comment on Homebrew/homebrew-core#10380 because it appeared as a red herring of a side effect during diagnosis of that same issue.  Per this further comment on that issue, further corrections to autogen.sh may remain desired after the merger of this pull request into master.

Machine with AVX, AVX2, SSE4.1 support.

Tests after the fix
Simple make

Builds fine until completion.
CLI trial, from the repository home:

export TEST_IMG=/tmp/tesseract_test.jpg
curl -o $TEST_IMG https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4KhEQKyByXs/maxresdefault.jpg
export TESSDATA_PREFIX=/path/to/4.0/tessdata
./api/.libs/tesseract $TEST_IMG stdout -l eng

Results in:
Warning. Invalid resolution 0 dpi. Using 70 instead.
Estimating resolution as 2122
SAMPLE TEXT

make training

Builds fine until completion.
Same CLI trial as above.

Extra Notes

I am aware of this issue/documentation where the build seems to work fine on macOS 10.13 with Homebrew. Here I build with MacPorts, so the problem may be due to this toolchain.",4,18
