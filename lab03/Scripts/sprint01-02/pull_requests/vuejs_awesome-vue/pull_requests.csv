Vuex state persistance and synchronization between tabs/windows.
Explanation
vuex-basement allows you to define a ""basement"" for your vue app that is shared between all open tabs/windows. The basement is simply a part (or all) of your vuex state that, optionally, can be made persisting, as well as being shared, accessable and reactive from any tab/window. This is accomplished through defining the paths of your state that form the persistant ""basement"" state, as well as adding the powerful global commit action to your vuex store, which allows you to issue a commit from any tab to all open tabs/windows, effectively synchronizing the app state across those tabs/windows.

Would be great to state v2 support in the readme or repo description.


@JiriChara vue-gravatar's readme doesn't exactly explain what this library does and a live demo would be nice.

@zack24q The readme should be in English.

@JetBrains All libraries on the list have a readme, would be good if this plugin does have one as well.

The only reason of removing your library from Awesome Vue is to make the list more useful.
As stated in the last comment at brillout/awesome-vue-refactor#6 (comment) please create an issue at brillout/awesome-vue-refactor to discuss whether your library should be part of the list or not.
I'm open to discuss what should or shouldn't be added to the list.
