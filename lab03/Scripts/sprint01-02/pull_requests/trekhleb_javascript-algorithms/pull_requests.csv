Note on stability with custom compare function.
let comp = new Comparator(function (a, b) {
    let x = a;
    let y = b;
    if (typeof a === ""string"") {
        x = a.length;

    }
    if (x === y) {

    }
    return x < y ? -1 : 1;
})

i.e.
Without
a, cc, bbb --> a, bbb, cc
With
a, cc, bbb --> a, cc, bbb
Even with the custom compare, you are not always guaranteed a stable sort
Example: Given: [aa, q, a, bbbb, ccc]
The algorithm will start with a SWAP from the right most index and the middle of the array.

START SWAP ""ccc"", ""a""
END SWAP (New Array: aa,q,ccc,bbbb,a)
""aa"" is greater than ""a""
START SWAP ""aa"", ""a""
END SWAP a,q,ccc,bbbb,aa
""ccc"" is greater than ""aa""
START INSRIGHT  (Given: a,q,bbbb,bbbb,aa)
END INSRIGHT (New Array: a,q,bbbb,aa,ccc)
""bbbb""is greater than ""aa""
START INSRIGHT (Given: a,q,bbbb,aa,ccc)
END INSRIGHT  (New Array: a,q,aa,ccc,bbbb)
