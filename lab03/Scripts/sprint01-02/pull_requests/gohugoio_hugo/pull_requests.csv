Data lives in /data/authors with one file per author. I thought about nesting it in /data/site/authors or /data/hugo/authors, but those seemed unnecessarily hidden.
Author front matter is an array to support multiple authors, though it will be up to themes to support multiple authors or not. There is a convenience .Author method to return a single author.
if there are multiple authors and this is used, there is no guarantee which author will be returned
I changed .Site.Author from map[string]interface{} to Author, though I don't know if that is in use outside of the embedded RSS feed
Social data should only be the username
For Author social details, I added a .URL() convenience method that returns canonical urls for major social networks
I added a params section to the author, though as of right now it is map[string]string instead of map[string]interface{}
I use snake_case in the data files but templates will access them with PascalCase
Here's a sample author file

given_name      = ""Derek""
family_name     = ""Perkins""
display_name    = ""Derek Perkins""
thumbnail       = ""img link""
image           = ""img link""
short_bio       = ""super short bio""
bio             = ""Here's Derek's awesome bio""
email           = ""derek@email.com""

[social]
    facebook    = ""derekperkins""
    github      = ""derekperkins""
    twitter     = ""derek_perkins""
    googleplus  = ""DerekPerkins1""

[params]
   random       = ""whatever you want""",13,79
