Global policies: policies located in config/policies are now accessible through the entire app using the global.myGlobalPolicy syntax in routes.json files
Restricted scope policies: policies used without prefix from a routes.json file are restricted to the current API or plugin scope
Plugins policies: policies located in plugin/myPlugin/config/policies are now accessible through the entire app using the plugins.myPlugin.myPluginPolicy syntax
policies folders and files are now located in config folders
policies are now part of the config objects

Documentation
Global policies
From now, you can define global policies which are reusable through your entire app.
Usage
Define your policy:
// ./config/policies/isAuthenticated.js
'use strict';

/**
 * `isAuthenticated` policy.
 */

module.exports = async (ctx, next) => {
  // Add your before logic here.

  await next();

  // Add your after logic here.
};
Usage from an API or from a plugin:
// ./api/car/routes.json
{
  ""routes"": [
    {
      ""method"": ""GET"",
      ""path"": ""/car"",
      ""handler"": ""Car.find"",
      ""config"": {
        ""policies"": [
          ""*isAuthenticated""
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
Scoped policies
A policy defined in an API or plugin is usable only from this API or plugin. You don't need any prefix to use it.
Usage
Define your policy:
// ./api/car/config/policies/carPolicy.js
'use strict';

/**
 * `carPolicy` policy.
 */

module.exports = async (ctx, next) => {
  // Add your before logic here.

  await next();

  // Add your after logic here.
};
Usage from the API or from a plugin:
// ./api/car/routes.json
{
  ""routes"": [
    {
      ""method"": ""GET"",
      ""path"": ""/car"",
      ""handler"": ""Car.find"",
      ""config"": {
        ""policies"": [
          ""carPolicy""
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
Use plugins policies from APIs
Plugins policies are usable from any app API.
Usage
Define your policy:
// ./plugins/auth/config/policies/isAuthenticated.js
'use strict';

/**
 * `isAuthenticated` policy.
 */

module.exports = async (ctx, next) => {
  // Add your before logic here.

  await next();

  // Add your after logic here.

Usage from an API:
// ./api/car/routes.json

        ""policies"": [
          ""plugins.auth.isAuthenticated""
        ]
      }
    }

Global policy: strapi.config.myPolicy
API policy: strapi.api.myApi.config.myPolicy
Plugin policy: strapi.plugins.myPlugin.config.myPolicy",2,1

Install plugin from the CLI
Uninstall plugin from the CLI

Documentation
Plugin installation
Allows the developer to install a plugin, using the CLI.
Basic usage
Considering you want to install a plugin named content-manager you can run the following command:
$ strapi install content-manager.
This supposed that this plugin is published on the npm registry as strapi-plugin-content-manager.
The command installs the plugin in the node_modules folder of your Strapi application, and then, move the plugin itself in the ./plugins folder, so you can edit it and version it.
Development mode
In order to make contributors life easier, a command is dedicated to development mode:
$ strapi install plugin-name --dev (eg. $ strapi install content-manager --dev)
This command creates a symlink between the Strapi application and the plugin, which should have been previously installed globally ($ npm link or $ npm install plugin-name -g).
Plugin uninstallation
Allows the developer to uninstall a plugin, using the CLI.
Basic usage
Command: $ strapi uninstall plugin-name (eg. $ strapi uninstall content-manager).
This command simply removes the plugin folder.",2,1

Override Koa context to bind the new logger into it. It allows the user calls directly the logger through the context.

Deactivate security middlewares in the development environment.

Documentation
On every start, the files ./admin/admin/src/config.plugins.json is generated based on the installed plugins. The file should look like this:
[
  {
    ""id"": ""content-type-builder"",
    ""source"": {
      ""development"": ""http://localhost:1337/admin/content-type-builder/main.js"",
      ""production"": ""http://localhost:1337/admin/content-type-builder/main.js"",
      ""test"": ""http://localhost:1337/admin/content-type-builder/main.js""
    }
  }
]
This file is also included and minified in the build. This file indicates to the admin what are the plugins that need to be initialized and their sources URLs to require them.

Note: The administration panel will choose the source based on the environment build.

Host the admin and plugins on another server/CDN
If your administration is hosted on another server than your Strapi project, you need to re-build the admin with the new configuration.

Note: We highly recommend to start your server before launching the build to ensure the ./admin/admin/src/config/plugins.json is up-to-date.

./config/environment/**/server.json
{
  ""host"": ""localhost"",
  ""port"": 1337,
  ""autoReload"": {
    ""enabled"": true
  },
  ""cron"": {
    ""enabled"": false
  },
  ""admin"": {
    ""path"": ""/dashboard"",
    ""build"": {
      ""host"": ""http://admin.myapp.com"",
      ""backend"": ""http://api.myapp.com:8080"",
      ""plugins"": {
        ""source"":  ""host"",
        ""folder"": ""/plugins""
      }
    }
  }
}

path (string): Allow to change the URL to access the admin (default: /admin).
build

host (string): URL to access the admin panel (default: http://localhost:1337/admin).
backend (string): URL that the admin panel and plugins will request (default: http://localhost:1337).

plugins

source (origin, remote, custom): More details below.
folder (string): More details below.







Source
The source setting allows you to define the URLs to require to plugins in the admin panel.
Three modes are available


host will use the host setting to generate the source URL for the plugins (example: http://admin.myapp.com/**/main.js).


origin will use the origin URL. It means the default host and port (example: http://localhost:1337/**/main.js).


custom will use the source defined in each ./plugins/**/config/sources.json file.


Based on the previous configurations file, it will generate the following index.html to require the shared dependencies vendor.dll.js and the plugins.
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <div id=""app""></div>
    <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""/dashboard/vendor.dll.js""></script>
    <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""/dashboard/main.js""></script>
    <script src=""http://admin.myapp.com/plugins/content-type-builder/main.js""></script>
  </body>
</html>
Folder
For example, if you decide to put your admin panel and plugins builds on an AWS S3 server, your files structure could like that:
- src/
  - 0bd35bad03d09ca61ac6cce225112e36.svg
  - 1d51d8767683a24635702f720cda4e26.svg
  - af3aefd0529349e40e4817c87c620836.png
  - config/
    - plugins.json
  - main.js
  - main.js.map
  - plugins/
    - content-type-builder/
      - 0bd35bad03d09ca61ac6cce225112e36.svg
      - 1d51d8767683a24635702f720cda4e26.svg
      - af3aefd0529349e40e4817c87c620836.png
      - main.js
      - main.js.map
  - vendor.dll.js
  - vendor.dll.js.map

The folder setting allows you to tell to the admin panel that the plugins are in a sub-folder named plugins.
Host the plugins on another servers/CDN
It allows you to override the generated source URL per environment. This feature is useful if you decide to host your build on AWS S3, etc.
./plugins/**/config/sources.json
{
  ""sources"": {
    ""production"": ""http://s3.aws.com/xxxx/main.js"",
    ""test"": ""http://s3.aws.com/test/xxxx/main.js""
  }
}
So the ./admin/admin/src/config.plugins.json will look like this:
[
  {
    ""id"": ""content-type-builder"",
    ""source"": {
      ""development"": ""http://localhost:1337/admin/content-type-builder/main.js"",
      ""production"": ""http://s3.aws.com/xxxx/main.js"",
      ""test"": ""http://s3.aws.com/test/xxxx/main.js""
    }
  }

Bonus

The Redux stores are now correctly named which will help everyone who is using Redux Dev Tools to identify the right store.
The current locale is exposed through strapi.currentLanguage.

New rules

The plugin icon has to be named logo.svg in the /admin/src/assets/images/ folder.

after that the grant config (plugin_users-permissions_grant in core_store) will not be able changed even if someone want to add one more provider using grant.
The only way he can do is to remove  core_store.{key: plugin_users-permissions_grant} record in db manually.
I think we may want to reload the grant config into db, when we change the provider config (here i only handle the situation of adding/removing a provider)

Decrease the building time in dev mode
Prevent the babel-polyfill - error Error: only one instance of babel-polyfill is allowed from occurring when running the app on the build and hopefully in production.
Fix the npm run setup command that was broken when ran in the admin.

🔥 Results 🔥 :

Previously, when we started the admin dev server (localhost:4000/admin) Webpack used to build the project twice with the entire app's configurations (plugins's controllers, services...).
It was due to two processes running at the same time : strapi.load({ ... }) and npm run build which were making Webpack watching, thus building to many files... Since, the first process is necessary when building the admin from a project and starting the dev server, it was moved to the prestart and prebuild scripts from the strapi-admin.
Now the admin is built once with a ≃ 20s decrease.
Similarly, the npm run setup command works again when ran from a project.",3,0

I included the translation for EN and DE. Is there a suggested way on how to handle / get the rest of the translations?
During the implementation I ran into an issue similar to #883 and followed the same strategy as in #928 to resolve it. However, I don't think it's a very sophisticated solution as it could lead to developers handling values differently. The solution in #928 suggests to treat every string except 'true' as false, if I didn't stumble upon this issue I might have chosen to treat every string except 'false'as true (which feels more like javascript anyway). What I propose is essentially to handle 'trueish' and 'falseish' values from environment / config files in a more robust and centralized manner, so there's no room for interpretation.",2,0

This is PR is a POC (and still a little WIP to make more tests) about to transform the enumeration type of a model into the Enum in GraphQL.
The goal is to improve the schema comprehension for developers who will use the GraphQL API

Actually, I add the attribute enumName to an attribute to generate easier a friendly-name, ex:
""type"": {
  ""type"": ""enumeration"",
  ""required"": true,
  ""default"": ""STANDARD"",
  ""enum"": [
    ""STANDARD"",
    ""SLIM"",
    ""ENHANCED"",
  ],
  ""enumName"": ""MODEL_TYPE""
}

Otherwise, the generated name is based on the first entry in the list.

This PR fixes the bug mentioned below. It does so by:
Removing the dependency on the strapi.plugins['users-permissions'].config.actions file, and fetching the permissions from the database and formats the results accordingly. This is to ensure that no matter the environment, the permissions saved to the database are consistent with the current controllers in the application.
If this solution is accepted, then further changes have to be made to completely remove the strapi.plugins['users-permissions'].config.actions.json file from the project as this is no longer required.

Hey guys :)
It seems that the connector and client properties in database.json files for prod and staging were hardcoded.
I know that its easy to edit them after you initialised your instance but if you want to dockerize your Strapi this becomes a little more difficult.
So for instance if you initialised your Strapi instance to use MySQL your production and staging  database.json were incorrectly set up with ""client"": ""mongo"" and ""connector"": ""strapi-hook-mongoose"".
What I did:
I used the settings that were used to create the develop database.json to create the staging and production ones.
Let me know your thoughts, if you think this is something valuable and/or want me to change something in my code. Open to suggestions :)",3,11

Currently the use of environment variables in the configuration files is allowed, however the values are not replaced building the administration panel. You can clearly see the error if you try to use an environment variable as the value of the host parameter in the server.json file:

As can see, the value was used as an ordinary string; they were not replaced by the value of the environment variable.
This PR moves the code that makes that interpretation to strapi-utils trying to make it a shared functionality. In addition to been invoked originally in the same place, with this changes also it's called by webpack, getting a consistent result in the build.
You can see here the result of this change:

Notes:

I keep the name of the function. Could have a better name maybe?
Is strapi-utils the correct place? 🤔

Hi! I needed to catch errors from strapi to do some custom error handling logic. I noticed that errors are not propagated to Koa as they are catch in the boom middleware (at least the errors from controllers?) so i would like to propose a way to get these errors propagate if configured.
I added into /config/environments/development/server.json:
""emitErrors"": true,

Then anyone can do in server setup the following:
const strapi = require('strapi');
strapi.app.on('error', (err, ctx) => {  'Your logic goes here' });
strapi.start();

I would like to propagate any error into this part but for now is a good start. What do you think?

Description
As mentioned in #1462, I'm starting to work on adding support for MSSQL database (a personal requirement). Pursuing the best approach and good code quality, I'll create different PRs with gradual changes seeking a easy code review.
The scope of this PR is just refactor the actual implementation on strapi-hook-bookshelf without changing his behavior. The objective here is avoid the queries manually created and increase the use of Knex.js
Pros
With using Knex.js --a dependency that Strapi already have-- it's expected obtain the benefits of a dedicated query builder: the work of more number and experienced eyes.
Avoiding reinventing the wheel, we could reduce the lines of code[1], with that reducing the maintenance costs in this project and the keep the space for bugs at the minimum.
Also, this will open the opportunity to create better schemas for relational databases, like add real constrains and real foreign keys[2], increasing their performance and data integrity.
Performance: On the case of altering tables when new field are added, this implementation done it in just one query execution; originally executes one sentence by field.
Cons

Increase the dependency with Knex.js.
...? 🤷‍♂️

What is tested

 Creation of the initial schema whit the creation of a new project (35ad208)
 Primary keys with different field types than numeric (d456ee3)
 Particular case UUID primary key on PostgeSQL (d456ee3)
 Particular case ""on update"" trigger on MySQL (3253e01)
 Creating a Content-Type with all possible data-types offer by the GUI (7ca629b)
 Adding fields to an already create model (a7f6b68)
 Content-type with ""media"" field type
 Relations

Results
All databases

[✔] Primary key constraints with no-numeric data types
: In two steps; first creates the table for later execute an ALTER query to add the constraint.

MySQL

[✔] Add keywork unsigned to primary keys
[✔] Adds default character set utf8 on every table definition
[✔] on update current_timestamp trigger removed from updated_at
: Is important?. With PostgreSQL this trigger is not created
: Bring back with 3253e01 following advice of @derrickmehaffy
[✔] enum types as text; not native
[✔] all text fields as longtext
[?] float field change from double to float(8, 2)
: Implications? Can we leave with this?
[✔] All new fields added with just one query execution
: Original implementation executes one query by field

PostgreSQL

[✔] not null constraint removed from primary keys
: Not a problem. PRIMARY KEY enforces the same data constraints as a combination of UNIQUE and NOT NULL
[✔] Change timestamp with time zone to timestamptz
: They are equivalent
[✔] json type as jsonb
[?] float field change from double precision to real
: Implications? Can we leave with this?
[?] ""date"" fields now comes with default value to current_timestamp
: Implications?. Isn't changed in the code?
: As with MySQL, result of share the same code
[✔] All new fields added with just one query execution
: Original implementation executes one query by field

Documentation




So this is a major overhaul of the documentation.
The reason to introduce a server-side-rendered but javascript enabled documentation is to easily implement documentation modules such as API generator. See #1758.
You will get the following features:

Development and deployment should be a lot more comfortable (I wrote a little blogpost about the benefits compared to regular content management here: https://happy-css.com/articles/from-processwire-to-vuepress-why-i-gave-up-my-shiny-wysiwyg-for-a-static-site-generator/)
Hot Module Replacement - you can add content during development and stay at the same page/scroll height
Vue Components - dynamic explanations are easier to build than gifs with animations.

Building the project:
cd docs
npm i
# Development
npm run dev
# localhost:8080
# Alternatively:
npm i -g vuepress
vuepress dev
Todos left:

 check docs for style
 check if sidebar is ok (for both versions)
 replace blockquotes with info containers (https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/markdown.html#custom-containers)
 add correct metadata and favicon",4,8

Main update on the Plugin
Problems and fixes
The SSO works on initial registration but not on re-login
In the React SSO example project I could login with Microsoft account for the first time, but not for the second time.
There were two places that caused this bug
No provider in the user model
while the provider service uses user.provider to decide if the user already exists or not, the model doesn't have provider field anymore hence, it always think the user exists but it's not registered with the requested provider resulting to respond Auth.form.error.email.taken error.
The provider was somehow removed in this commit: 688defc#diff-18cc44092da248f6a77fa8e1c3840153
I re-added provider field: 17d5e29
Bootstrap code of content manager mutates global strapi model
After I added provider in the model, somehow the user data which was created by registration via SSO still lacked provider field. After adding a few break points, I found the bootstrap code in content manager mutates the global strapi.models object.
I fixed this particular bug in the following commit:  4beab15
Though the commit fixed the issue that I was experiencing, I worry that we may have similar bugs somewhere in the module as we mutate objects here and there. I think it's good to refactor so that it doesn't mutate objects, but probably in another PR.
### SSO didn't work when Strapi app is hosted in https server
I found that the callback URL which Strapi sends to SSO auth server always starts with http even when it's hosted on https server. That's because the protocol was hardcoded to 'http'. I found a few more places where http was hardcoded, but I fixed only the part where SSO matters because that's what I could test.
I fixed it in the following commit:
12cc6d6
I assumed that process.env.PROTOCOL would be a good place to set whether the server is 'http' or 'https', but let me know if you prefer different variable.
There is another bug that the actual callback URL that Strapi sends to SSO auth server is different from what user can see from the settings screen, but this isn't blocking user to use SSO and can be fixed in another PR, I guess.",6,20

Because of a mistake I made on my original forked repo.
My current PR is a 🐛 Bug fix for ISSUE #1543
It's the new PR #2140 which I was not able to merge.
It's a main update on the: Admin
In PR#2140, my reviewer @lauriejim told me:
""With your code, when I insert a new line in the description, I save, then when I try to see my description I lost the multi lines.
The job to do it to not loose it.""
Reminder of the ISSUE#1543:
When a user is creating a new Content Type through The Admin/Content Type Builder he can set a description in a text area. If he sets a multilines text

No saving is possible. an error message is displayed ""request.error.model.read""
If strapi is restarted it doesn't work due to an ""SyntaxError: ~/api/MyHappyModel/models/MyHappyModel.settings.json: Unexpected token in JSON at position 152"" exception.

The fix consists of updating two files in the strapi-plugin-content-manager

ContentTypeBuilder.js
helpers.js

In both create and update model methods, description is now parsed to replace each newline by a '\n' string.
The replacement is managed by an helper function called escapeNewlines.
Multi-lines is kept.
To go further, if I create a multi4 model type with multilines the json is created as below:
{
""connection"": ""default"",
""collectionName"": ""multi4"",
""info"": {
""name"": ""multi4"",
""description"": ""multi\nlines\ntext\ntext2\ntext4\n""
},
""options"": {
""timestamps"": true

Let's say we have a product content type and a category centent type. those two models share many-to-many relation, and when we are querying categories we have the expected result, Ex :
Query :
{
  categories {
    Name
    products {
      Name
    }
  }
}


Result :
{
  ""data"": {
    ""categories"": [

categories should not be empty, it should be something like  that :
...
""categories"": [

          {

Plugin

Current GraphQL plugin builds the query resolvers with a fixed id: ID on all models. That means, if the user makes customizations for any given API model to have an id field from different type, a String for example, like this:
{
  ""connection"": ""default"",
  ""collectionName"": ""blog"",
  ""info"": {
    ""name"": ""blog"",
  },
  ""options"": {
    ""timestamps"": true,
  },
  ""attributes"": {
    ""_id"": {
      ""type"": ""string"",
      ""configurable"": false
    },
   ...,
    ""text"": {
      ""default"": """",
      ""type"": ""text"",
      ""required"": true
    }
  }
}

When trying to query with GraphQL like this:
query {
    blog(id: ""the_id_value"") {
         title
         text
    }
}

you will get an error saying something like ID expected but received String
Solution
This PR adds support for fixing that. It fetches the model defined primaryKey to use its type.
Also, there is a little modification on the strapi-generate-api  generator, as it adds a check on the format by default via a regex, which is not correct if using a string in its place.
