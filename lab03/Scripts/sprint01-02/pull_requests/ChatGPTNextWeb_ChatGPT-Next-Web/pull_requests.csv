Optimized Query Logic
The query logic for both subscribed and non-subscribed accounts has been optimized to improve performance and accuracy. For non-subscribed accounts, the 'startDate' parameter will now be set to 90 days ago.
Resolved Markdown Issue
This pull request also resolves an issue where internal links were not redirecting properly in markdown, and optimizes the behavior for external links to open in a new window.
Testing

First, I've added French translation content, which is a further development based on my previous French translation modifications. If you don't need this part of the French translation content, I can split it out.
Secondly, I've added support for next export. Since our project is currently using the experimental feature of appDir set to true, this prevents us from using the next export command to export static pages. To address this issue, I've extracted the content of app/api into pages and transformed layout and pages.tsx into the basic content of the pages folder. Finally, I've adjusted the control scripts in package.json to compress and decompress the pages file directory, thereby achieving a structure where the app directory and pages directory coexist through the appDir configuration.
这次PR主要包含两个重要的更新。
首先，我增加了法语翻译的内容，这是在我之前的法语翻译修改基础上进行的进一步开发。如果你不需要这部分法语翻译的内容，我可以将其拆分出来。
其次，我增加了对next export的支持。由于我们的项目目前使用了实验性质的appDir为true，这导致我们无法使用next export命令导出静态页面。为了解决这个问题，我将app/api的内容提取到pages，并将layout和pages.tsx转化为pages文件夹的基础内容。最后，我通过修改package.json的控制脚本来压缩和解压pages文件目录，从而实现app目录和pages目录通过appDir配置来共存的结构。",2,0
