EDIT: Some explanation, for people unfamiliar with the situation: The Trello board is very outdated, so it causes much confusion to students. For example, this conversation on discord: https://discord.com/channels/744385009028431943/744682430853808178/1208263221086126161. We usually recommend people in the discord server to just fork this repo and add âœ… next to courses they have completed. This PR removes the information about Trello board and adds the suggestion from the discord server to this repo too. (This PR closes #1089)
There are many third-party/outdated/unmaintained materials related to OSSU on the internet (like the Trello board and some notion templates from youtubers). This PR also adds a warning to students to be aware that those materials are outdated.
The spreadsheet used to track time required to complete the curriculum can also become outdated some time. The current status is that some links to courses are outdated (like HTDP -> SPD change is not there) and experimental suggestions such as CS50P are not mentioned, but the spreadsheet still correctly estimates the time required, which is its main function. This PR also adds a warning regarding this.",2,1
