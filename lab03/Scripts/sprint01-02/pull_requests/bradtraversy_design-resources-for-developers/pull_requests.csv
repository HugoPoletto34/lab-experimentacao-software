The concept caught on when UI Movement was launched on Product Hunt and was upvoted more than 1,000 times. It eventually grew to over 25,000 subscribers and thousands of visits per month. The simple newsletter website was eventually updated for easier browsing and filtering. Each new design was tagged so that you can easily find the most popular design animations for whatever design element you're interested in. In 2020 UI Movement needed to change. Based on my experience with UI Movement and realted site I run, I came up with the concept of what Screenlane is today.
