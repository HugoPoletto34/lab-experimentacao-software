This is a first draft WIP to get feedback on my approach. This pull request implements SIP002 url (parsing and generation for QR code with backward-compatibility of accepting old-style urls and generating old-style urls when there is no plugin for the config), and SIP003 plugin interface for shadowsocks-windows.

SIP002 has unit tests and proven to work.
SIP003 needs a little bit of testing, would appreciate feedback on the approach and fresh eyes to see if I made any mistakes.

Hope to eventually get this merged soon :-)",6,16

Notes

The PAC mode now defaults to whitelist mode.
geositeDirectGroups is initialized with cn and geolocation-!cn@cn.
geositeProxiedGroups is initialized with geolocation-!cn.
When geositePreferDirect is false (default), PAC works in whitelist mode. Exception rules are generated from geositeDirectGroups. Unmatched domains goes through the proxy.
When geositePreferDirect is true, PAC works in blacklist mode. Blocking rules are generated from geositeProxiedGroups. Exception rules are generated from geositeDirectGroups. Unmatched domains are connected to directly.
The new default values make sure that:

When in whitelist mode, Chinese domains, including non-Chinese companies' Chinese CDNs, are connected to directly.
When in blacklist mode, only non-Chinese domains goes through the proxy. Chinese domains, as well as non-Chinese companies' Chinese CDNs, are connected to directly.",3,4
