theme-deafult 项目地址是 https://github.com/ElementUI/theme-default
theme-default 作为子模块引入到 element 里，第一次用的话先 init 然后 update
git submodule init
git submodule update
如果是第一次 clone 直接通过加 recursive 的方式初始化
git clone git@github.com:ElemeFE/element.git --recursive
如果不熟悉 git submodule 的话，操作子模块最简单的方式是到 packages/theme-default 下操作 git。",3,0

之前我提了这个feature request  #2014
我按照自己的理解实现了一下， 不知道符不符合你们的要求：
用法：
<template>
  <div>
    <el-button @click=""open"">Test</el-button>
  </div>
</template>

<style scoped>
</style>

<script type=""text/ecmascript-6"">
  export default {
    methods: {
      open() {
        this.$alert('这是一段内容', '标题名称', {
          confirmButtonText: '确定',
          loading: false,  // 设定初始值，默认就是false
          autoHide: false,   // 阻止点击confirm，导致alert直接关闭，默认值是true，所以兼容原来的
          // 将alert的实例传进callback，并暴露showLoading，hideLoading和hide3个api。
          callback: (action, alert) => {
            alert.showLoading()
            setTimeout(_ => {
              alert.hideLoading()
              alert.hide()
            }, 2000)
          }
        });
      }
    }
  };

I'm using a DSL library to generate Vue VNode by method call. This works for most component in Element. For example, vnodeHelper.elCol.elCol() can correctly generate vnode in the format like h('elCol') .
However, some Element component has different naming schema so vnode helper fails to find corresponding components since Vue will not normalize snake case name.
Given most component names in Element is CamelCase, I think it might be good practice to enforce the rule to every component.
Looking forward to your opinion and Happy new year!",3,0

支持messagebox的loading   #2014
只能支持callback模式，promise的情况下，promise只能被confirm或者reject一次，情况会比较怪异。比如点了confirm之后，loading出现，这时候应该也可以关闭messagebox，但是promise的reject不会再触发，所以message就关不掉了。
messageBox用的是单例，为了防止hide api的调用出现错乱，为messageBox的component加一个id，用于杜绝这类问题。",2,2

原来的sortable的行为有点奇怪，需要点击的header里的向上和向下键，按键很小也比较难点，也不符合一般的做法。按照#1741 的讨论，我实现了一版。
通过default-sort-prop和default-sort-order设置初始排序的排序列和顺序。点击上下的按钮，就是toggle排序。其实如果直接把时间绑定在th上可能更好，考虑到你们的table支持header的tag sort，所以不太好改。",4,7
