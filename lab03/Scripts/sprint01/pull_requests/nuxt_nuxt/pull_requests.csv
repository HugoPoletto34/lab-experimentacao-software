only SSR, no universal app (i.e. no inserted script tags).

Fixes #878

Notes:
The most controversial/needs-discussion change required to fully pass the AMP validator was the addition of a new mode value for nuxt.config.js of ssr, which when detected prevents the insertion of any <script> tags into the body of the rendered page.
In order to allow re-using the exact same Nuxt.js routes for both AMP and non-AMP uses, it may be more useful to have that calculation performed during SSR (e.g. passing a query flag to the URL ""http://mysites/dogs?amp=true"", etc). I'm new to the Nuxt.js codebase, and didn't see an obvious way to support that in lib/core/renderer.js so I'm happy to dive into that if folks would like.

Split generator logic in to separate methods
Separate the business logic from the presentation layer: make the Generator class a silent library class that doesn't communicate with the user itself (eg removed debug call's from generator.js)

generate:distRemoved has been added to log the Destination folder cleaned statement
generate:distCopied has been added to log the Static & build files copied statement
generate:routeFailed has been added for when an unhandled exception occurred during renderRoute
generate:routeCreated has been moved to the generateRoute method so we can include the path


To be able to log errors during page rendering they are kept separately until all hooks have been called

This would mainly be needed for special implementations of the router module, but since the router is built so early in the lifecycle it makes it hard to route properly if you need the API to define the routes for the app in some way (like a wordpress backend).
nuxt-community/router-module#4
My implementation may be improved as I am not familiar enough with the codebase to be confident in it, the update is meant to open up the discussion on it. To me this update is extremely simple and should not cause any problems in nuxt, at least I have not seen any errors associated with the update in my own testing (I edited directly out of node_modules then applied the update to this fork, since this functionality is a requirement in the project I am working on).
Thoughts? The idea here does not need to be merged, more just to show a simple way to allow API driven routing.
Here is an example of, if using the router module how you can use the router.js file with this update.
export async function createRouter(options) {
    // since the axios module has not been initialized yet it needs to be included manually
    const response = await axios.get(process.env.API_URL + '/wp/v2/menus')
    console.log(response.data)

This PR adds a new option server for nuxt.config.js in order to specify PORT and HOST in the config file.
// nuxt.config.js
export default {
  server: {
    port: 8000,
    host: '0.0.0.0'

Breaking change:
Merge the getLatestHost(argv) function into loadNuxtConfig(argv).
port and host now is accessable in options.server.
- const { port, host } = getLatestHost(argv)
+ const { port, host } = options.server
Reasons:

getLatestHost(argv) needs to read the config. It's not ideal to read the file again.
options.mode is overrided by argv in the loadNuxtConfig, so override options.server in loadNuxtConfig is more consistency and simplier.",7,16

Description



Related to #3723
Because css-loader has removed options.alias and is using loader-utils for url() now.
So this is a breaking change for <url>, users need to prefix ~ when they want to use alias:

Now: please use url(~assets)(recommend), url(~@/assets) or url(~~/assets)
Do not use: url(~/assets)

As I believe a common/recognisable interface benefits the users I used Nuxt's hooks system to add the routes, but that means we need to be able to call a hook only once. Otherwise every iteration of the generate.concurrency loop would be adding the same routes over and over again.
De-duplication can be implement by:

hooking into generate:extendRoutes to store a unique routes list
before adding the route in your generate:addRoutes hook check if its already listed in your routes list

The only downside to this implementation afaik is that we call decorateWithPayloads on every iteration. Maybe we could add an observer on the routes array in the future and only call decorateWithPayloads when routes has really changed.",7,9

 Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)

Description
When you set options.buildDir or options.generate.dir to a path equal or lower then options.rootDir, you will completely remove your project when you build or generate your project as these paths are indiscriminately removed with fs-extra.remove in builder/builder.js and builder/generator.js . I have added a test in options.js which will throw an error when this would be the case.
I feel I need to clarify for everybody here that I did not make that mistake while playing around and that because I did not make that mistake I did not lose my whole project and will not have to revert to a day old backup 😊 😢

 Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
 New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
 Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)

Description
Replaces several calls to Promise.all with a wrapper that does the same thing as before, but now accumulates the rejection errors from each of the promises and throws them as an array of errors after all of the supplied promises have resolved or rejected.
This change leaves it to application authors who use nuxt.renderRoute(path, { req, res }), lib/core/middleware/nuxt, etc... to choose to handle any promise errors that occur inside of a page Component's asyncData or fetch methods. Before this change, calls to asyncData or fetch that resulted in a promise rejection or error that would be considered unhandled, regardless of whether or not there was only one rejection in the promises provided to Promise.all; an ""unhandledRejection"" would be emitted at the process level.
// Results in a caught rejection and also in an ""unhandledRejection"" event:

await Promise.all([ Promise.reject(12345) ]).catch((error) => error) 
// => 12345 (uncaught: 12345)

await Promise.all([ Promise.reject(1), Promise.reject(2) ]).catch((error) => error) 
// => 1 (uncaught: 1) (uncaught: 2)
import { allPromisesHandled } from ""lib/app/utils"";
// Results in a caught rejection and no ""unhandledRejection"" event:

await allPromisesHandled([ Promise.reject(12345) ]).catch((errors) => errors) 
// => [ 12345 ]

await allPromisesHandled([ Promise.reject(1), Promise.reject(2) ]).catch((errors) => errors) 
// => [ 1, 2 ]
— See allPromisesHandled in lib/app/utils.js
In my application(s), I listen for the process ""unhandledRejection"" event and log the error/promise before shutting down. I wanted to be able to properly handle the promise rejection and also leave my listener for ""unhandledRejection"" in case somewhere in my codebase creates a promise without anticipating and handling its rejection.
Possible side-effects that I've thought of (but I don't think they'll be an issue):

A render waiting on a page Component with both an asyncData and fetch, where one rejects immediately(or at least before the other) will take longer than it did before. Promise.all could be thought of as a 'race to any rejection or for all to resolve', where allPromiseHandled will 'wait for all to reject or resolve' before resolving or rejecting itself. (I.e. eager vs patient rejection)
The error thrown by a rejected promise collection is now sometimes an Array (if there is only one error involved, that is thrown instead of an array for asyncData/fetch rejections), which may be confusing to some theoretical existing error handling code outside of nuxt's codebase. In some places, I've made the resulting array itself error-like, using a function I made function named compactMultipleErrors in lib/app/utils.js; It assigns a message and stack property to the array. (message: based on concatenations of the error messages within, stack: first truthy stack property in the errors array)

Release Notes

babel/babel
v7.1.2
Compare Source
Same as v7.1.1, except compiled against Node 6 instead of Node 8 by accident (e.g had async functions).
v7.1.1
Compare Source

EDIT: had a publish issue here as well where it compiled against Node 8 instead of Node 6 so 7.1.2 will fix this.
Also force publish @babel/runtime and @babel/runtime-corejs2. We need to fix the publishing around that since Lerna doesn't pickup the @babel/helpers changes as there is no ""dependency""

Reverting #​584

The TypeAlias ""conversion"" to a function has issues. Sounds like we need to rethink the change, most likely we can just actually change the scoping rather than hardcode an AST change.

 Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)

Description
Related to #4002. Some tools (Including the current version of vue-loader) implicitly use process.env.NODE_ENV to align their options. This change only sets the best value for NODE_ENV if not already set so it won't break anything.

The reason for including before any require() is that some modules may need this env during evaluation.
The reason for not refactoring this logic inside bin/nuxt is binaries portability. (nuxt-start directly is being called)

Description



Background: CSSNano is currently applied twice. Once with PostCSS loader and once with optimizeCSSAssetsPlugin. This is normally not harmful and good indeed but for incompatible CSS assets like Framework7 is problematic and currently there is not any way to disable or customize options.
This enhancement allows toggling or providing more options to both terser and optimizeCSS plugins. Also adds support for setting false value to minimize to disable them at all (for testing purposes and more webpack options compatibility)

Compare Source

Dramatically upgraded our XML parser, from the unmaintained sax package to the well-maintained saxes replacement. This increases our specification conformance, including rejecting certain ill-formed XML documents that were previously accepted, and properly handling other constructs like empty comments, CDATA sections, and <script> elements. (lddubeau)
Added fieldsetEl.elements and fieldsetEl.type properties.
Added the options parameter to dom.runVMScript(). (SimenB)
Added the ability for custom resource loader fetch() implementations to see what element initiated the fetch. (sarvaje)
Fixed input and change events for <input> elements to be trusted and uncancelable.
""Fixed"" <script>s with the async attribute to not execute before sync <script>s that precede them. We still do not, in general, have proper execution of scripts during the initial parsing of a document, so this fix is more of a reduction of badness than an alignment with the specification. This behavior regressed in v12.0.0. (sarvaje)

DEPENDENCY UPDATES
A very special dependency update event! Since the release of
node-gyp@3.8.0, an awkward
version conflict that was preventing request from begin flattened was
resolved. This means two things:

We've cut down the npm tarball size by another 200kb, to 4.6MB
npm audit now shows no vulnerabilities for npm itself!

DETECT CHANGES IN GIT SPECIFIERS

0e1726c03
We can now determine if the commitid of a git dependency in the lockfile is derived
from the specifier in the package.json and if it isn't we now trigger an update for it.
(@​iarna)

OTHER BUGS

442d2484f
2f0c88351
631d30a34
When requesting the update of a direct dependency that was also a
transitive dependency to a version incompatible with the transitive
requirement and you had a lock-file but did not have a node_modules
folder then npm would fail to provide a new copy of the transitive
dependency, resulting in an invalid lock-file that could not self heal.
(@​iarna)
be5dd0f49
#​20715
Cleanup output of npm ci summary report.
(@​legodude17)
98ffe4adb
Node.js now has a test that scans for things that look like conflict
markers in source code.  This was triggering false positives on a fixture in a test
of npm's ability to heal lockfiles with conflicts in them.

Using npm audit fix, replace some transitive dependencies with security
issues with versions that don't have any.

AUDIT SHOULDN'T WAIT FOREVER
This will likely be reduced further with the goal that the audit process
shouldn't noticibly slow down your builds regardless of your network
situation.

3dcc240db
Timeout audit requests eventually.
(@​iarna)

Looking forward
We're still a way from having node@11, so now's a good time to ensure we
don't warn about being used with it.

ed1aebf55
Allow node@11, when it comes.
(@​iarna)

v6.0.0
Compare Source
Hey y'all! Here's another npm@6 release -- with node@10 around the corner,
this might well be the last prerelease before we tag 6.0.0! There's two major
features included with this release, along with a few miscellaneous fixes and
changes.
EXTENDED npm init SCAFFOLDING
Thanks to the wonderful efforts of @​jdalton of
lodash fame, npm init can now be used to invoke custom scaffolding tools!
You can now do things like npm init react-app or npm init esm to scaffold an
npm package by running create-react-app and create-esm, respectively. This
also adds an npm create alias, to correspond to Yarn's yarn create feature,
which inspired this.

008a83642 ed81d1426 833046e45
#​20303
Add an npm init feature that calls out to npx when invoked with positional
arguments.  (@​jdalton)

DEPENDENCY AUDITING
This version of npm adds a new command, npm audit, which will run a security
audit of your project's dependency tree and notify you about any actions you may
need to take.
The registry-side services required for this command to work will be available
on the main npm registry in the coming weeks. Until then, you won't get much out
of trying to use this on the CLI.
As part of this change, the npm CLI now sends scrubbed and cryptographically
anonymized metadata about your dependency tree to your configured registry, to
allow notifying you about the existence of critical security flaws. For details
about how the CLI protects your privacy when it shares this metadata, see npm help audit, or read the docs for npm audit
online. You
can disable this altogether by doing npm config set audit false, but will no
longer benefit from the service.

MORE package-lock.json FORMAT CHANGES?!

820f74ae2
#​20384
Add from field back into package-lock for git dependencies. This will give
npm the information it needs to figure out whether git deps are valid,
specially when running with legacy install metadata or in
--package-lock-only mode when there's no node_modules. This should help
remove a significant amount of git-related churn on the lock-file.
(@​zkat)

BUGFIXES

9d5d0a18a
#​20358
npm install-test (aka npm it) will no longer generate package-lock.json
when running with --no-package-lock or package-lock=false.
(@​raymondfeng)
e4ed976e2
2facb35fb
9c1eb945b
#​20390
Fix a scenario where a git dependency had a comittish associated with it
that was not a complete commitid.  npm would never consider that entry
in the package.json as matching the entry in the package-lock.json and
this resulted in inappropriate pruning or reinstallation of git
dependencies.  This has been addressed in two ways, first, the addition of the
from field as described in #​20384 means
we can exactly match the package.json. Second, when that's missing (when working with
older package-lock.json files), we assume that the match is ok.  (If
it's not, we'll fix it up when a real installation is done.)

 mini change for Nuxt command with v1.x

Description



add new option nuxt build --no-generate for SPA mode
I saw v2.x has this option for SPA mode without generate ./dist/** files.
my projects use v1.4.2, and customize an express server with TypeScript.
If I upgrade to v2.x, I need to refactor too many files.
(I use SPA mode, and do not need .html files. want to build faster)
So, I refer nuxt-build of v2.x to make this change.

Description
Yarn sometimes tries to move packages into a subpackage. (yarn moved babel-loader dependency into node_modules/@nuxt/builder-edge/node_modules/babel-loader when upgraded a project) This break builds when resolving webpack loaders because they are being required from root package nuxt builder.
This PR is the same as a workaround for '@nuxtjs/babel-preset-app'/NPX. Only targetting babel loaders as they are more likely to move into the builder.

 New feature (a non-breaking change which adds functionality)

Description
It was quite difficult to do unit testing in the current CLI implementation, I hope you won't mind I refactored it a bit as well. Although I've added some overhead in some places, I think the benefit of improving the CLI consistency is worth it.
e.g. Things like the dynamic help text build could maybe also be moved to a build step, but I wasn't sure what the best way would be to do that with the monorepo so I will leave that for now (performance-wise its a non-issue imho).

Add a clean command so we can easily clean the nuxt folder. As currently only .nuxt* and dist folders are created during tests and/or builds, a simple find should suffice. If you want we could also separate between build:clean and test:clean but thought that would be too much abstraction
Better to use rimraf as find doesnt work on Windows.

v7.1.2
Compare Source
Same as v7.1.1, except compiled against Node 6 instead of Node 8 by accident (e.g had async functions).
v7.1.1
Compare Source

EDIT: had a publish issue here as well where it compiled against Node 8 instead of Node 6 so 7.1.2 will fix this.
Also force publish @babel/runtime and @babel/runtime-corejs2. We need to fix the publishing around that since Lerna doesn't pickup the @babel/helpers changes as there is no ""dependency""

Description



This pr adds a lock method for nuxt cli commands. The lock is used to prevent simultaneous builds for a project, so only one build can run at once.
The locking also helps automation, if you develop a long running nuxt command which is triggered by a cronjob you can rely on locking to prevent running that command more then once.
To make sure that the locking doesnt cause problems on exotic filesystems (CI's?), I have added a common --no-lock cli option to disable the locking.

As discussed on discord, the cli package could use a cjs stub so we dont have to use -r esm all the time. The other packages dont need this because they dont provide a point of entry
and are thus not directly invoked during development. They are either called through the cli or through jest when testing (and jest didnt seem to like all the esm stubs).

Until Nuxt 3.0 we can't change the array behavior as well because we can't introduce breaking changes.
This leads to problems where CSS minification won't succeed as plugins are used after cssnano is executed.
The option pushCssNano will move the cssnano plugin to the end of the plugin array, so it'll be executed last

 Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)

Description
There several issues currently with error handling.
If string error thrown in fetch - it will crash inside nuxt sources both on ssr and sp
If object error thrown in fetch - it will be displayed as [Object object] on spa and will be completely hidden on ssr
And during dev errors is printed twice with debug
On nuxt-error error object that is passed expected to be Object type, not Error, so passing any error instance there will throw error in console
Yes, its not good to throw not Errors but it can happen in client code or in some library code, so we should properly handle such cases.

This PR fixes route sorting in Node v11 (fix #4188).
The problem was caused because the route sorting in Nuxt was inherently unstable due to default ordering to be dictated by the order in which elements where compared. This caused issues in v11 because quicksort compares arr[0] with arr[1] but timsort does arr[0] with arr[arr.length - 1].
E.g. if you look at the dynamic-routes test then with quicksort it compared parent to test but in timsort it compared test to parent. As the default behaviour of route sorting was to return 1, this meant that if there was no 'special' case a was always sorted after b regardless of its actual value (hence the inherently unstable). This PR changes this behaviour to alphabetically sort a and b (with localeCompare) if there is no 'special' case.
I have also moved route sorting outside the forEach loop, there is no need to sort the routes array on every intermediate step and it probably saves a little bit of time to only sort it once.

 Bug fix (a non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
 New feature (a non-breaking change which adds functionality)
 Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)

Description



This PR aimed to resolve issue #4334 by processing the plain string entry of options.build.transpile.
The processing includes:

convert given path to os friendly file path (using path.normalize)
sanitize string for RegExp (using lodash escapeRegExp)
convert the sanitized string to RegExp (original)
use this RegExp for testing (original)

However, doing this conflict with one of the test case that uses escaped RegExp string as entry.
input: 'vue\\.test\\.js'
test: node_modules/vue.test.js
This will no longer work (thus breaking change) because we will now be expecting user to write plain string instead.
Unfortunally this test is also depended on the OS as it uses path.normalize which its behaviour is depended on OS.

Description
This change have some side effect for extendRoutes config. If you want to use named views, route item must contain chunkNames for each named component(except default).
For example:
  router: {
    extendRoutes(routes, resolve) {
      let index = routes[0].children.findIndex(route => route.name === 'index-child-id');
      let child = routes[0].children[index];
      child.components = {
        default: child.component,
        left: resolve(__dirname, 'components/childLeft.vue'),
      };
      child.chunkNames = {
        left: 'components/childLeft',
      };
      routes[0].children[index] = child;
    },
  },
If community can help resolve chunk name from component's path, it is would be great and there is no need to hardcode chunkNames manually.

 Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)

Description

This change lowers the size of @node/server from 12mb to 8.1mb (measured with du -sh, will be different when measuring with package-phobia)
Why? Removes the large caniuse-lite dependency - 3.1mb, which helps with #4377
Why not browserslist-useragent? browserslist-useragent checks compares the user agent against some conditionals, and checks if the browser name exists in browser-list (which depends on caniuse-lite). All we need to do is check if the user-agent browser exists in modern-browsers.json, and if the version is gte to the corresponding version.
Why change  modern-browsers.json? To add the other browsers that browserlist-useragent bundled into ""families"", and changing the naming to match ua-parser-js possible browser names

Notes

It might be a good idea to use useragent instead, as ua-parser-js isn't meant for browser detection.

Objectives


Better insights and inspection for server bundle


Remove all vue related dependencies from vue-renderer package as much as possible to reduce install size of nuxt-start


Support for single file distributions (serverless)


Remove server-bundle.json and use the standard .js files for dist/server


Mitigate CALL_AND_RETRY_LAST Allocation failed errors. Most of the cases happen on JSON.parse() the part when loading bundle. (#4225, #3465, #1728, #1601, #1481)


Reduce server dist size by removing escape characters caused by JSON serialize


Faster dev reloads and production start by removing extra JSON.serialize/JSON.parse time


Less memory usage


General performance improvements and refactors


Correctly ensure resources are available when using nuxt start or programmatically starting in production. (Changes applied but to prevent breaking changes delayed to Nuxt3)


TODO

 Minify server files for production
 Cleanup source-map handling for reading from serverBundle
 Remove fs-extra dependency from vue-renderer
 Decouple loadResources
 Programmatic build warn when no dist exists (vue-renderer)

Description



(Originally suggested by @Atinux)
For several reasons there are different kinds of shared state and memory leaks in development mode. This PR also fixes another important problem that when we globally register vue plugins with Vue.use() they will be remaining even when removed from the code. runInNewContext is highly recommanded to be disabled for production mode but for development time number of req/second rarely hits 5, it should be worthy.

Description
Fixes #4201
Currently when user defined a script-src list for CSP, the transformPolicyObject() would modify the CSP config object for EVERY unique SHA hash generated by nuxt. This will bloat up the CSP header until it exceed limit.
This patch fixes it by returning a new object when transforming the csp policy object.
Also the original use of Set seems unnecessary, not sure.

Added el.insertAdjacentElement() and el.insertAdjacentText().
Added the firing of a cancelable ""reset"" event to form.reset(). (epfremmer)
Added the type, value, and defaultValue properties to <output> elements, including their form reset behavior. (epfremmer)
Added the outputEl.htmlFor property.
Fixed the performance of parsing large text nodes, particularly noticeable for large inline <style> or <script> elements. This regressed in v11.6.0. To learn more, see V8 issue #​6730.
Fixed the style property on <a> and <area> elements. This regressed in v13.0.0.
Fixed node.isConnected to not always return false for nodes inside a shadow tree. (pmdartus)
Fixed <button type=""reset""> and <input type=""reset""> elements to actually perform a form reset when clicked, instead of doing nothing. (epfremmer)
Fixed el.setCustomValidity() for <output> and <fieldset>.
Fixed activation behavior when dispatching bubbling click events, so that for example calling el.click() on the child of a submit button element will submit the form.
Fixed our XML parsing code to ignore text outside the root element, instead of treating it as an error. (lddubeau)
Fixed XML serialization when elements had an unknown prefix.
Fixed radio button group name matching to be case-sensitive, per a spec update.
Fixed ""focus""/""blur"" events to be composed.
Fixed mediaElement.duration to default to NaN.
Fixed olEl.start to default to 1.
Fixed using XMLHttpRequest against non-existant file: URLs to treat that as a network error, instead of crashing. (pascalbayer) Note that in the future we may completely disable XMLHttpRequest usage against file: URLs to follow the browser security model.
Fixed document.title in SVG documents.
Fixed titleElement.text to return the child text content, instead of being the same as titleElement.innerHTML.
Fixed <textarea>s to properly account for child CDATA section nodes changing.
Fixed the value of Element.prototype[Symbol.unscopables].

⚠ Warning ⚠ (EDIT AFTER MERGE)
➡ Please be aware of #4563 , which will likely make this merged PR outdated. ⬅
Description
What if Typescript Support what just about setting a boolean variable to true ? 😎
Prequel
This PR is highly inspired by #4406 made by @chanlito, so special thanks to him.
His current PR state alters Nuxt packages even for non-TS projects, and will also break projects using their own TypeScript module, that's why I implemented a new way to provide the TS support.
Existing TS projects will be able to either keep their own implementation of TypeScript support OR use this built-in optional one.
I. Usage 👨‍💻👩‍💻
// nuxt.config.js
export default {
  build: {
    typescript: true // 🚀
  }
}
II. How it works behind the scenes ? ⚙
When the typescript option is set to true, and only if is set true, it alters the following Nuxt internal packages :
✏ Config (@nuxt/config)
Accept .ts(x) files for plugins and middleware
✏ Builder (@nuxt/builder) & Common(@nuxt/common)
Watch & Use .ts(x) files to generate routes (layouts & pages)
✏ Webpack (@nuxt/webpack)
Resolve .ts(x) files through Babel, passing the typescript option value to the Nuxt babel preset
✏ Babel (@nuxt/babel-preset-app)
Retrieve the typescript option from the preset options to use the @babel/preset-typescript Babel TypeScript preset.
✏ CLI (@nuxt/cli) [Suggestion not implemented yet]
Warning or Error if tsconfig.json not found in the source folder, using the srcDir config option
III. What about the documentation ? 📖
I suggest a Typescript section in the documentation OR a How to use Typescript ? in the FAQ.
I will (or at least propose to) take the lead on it if my proposal is accepted and submit a PR regarding this documentation. This latter will talk about type definitions as well (#4164).
IV. What about a Nuxt TS project example ? 📁
An example highly similar to the one in #4406 will be proposed in a different PR if this proposal is accepted.
V. What about tests ? 🛠
A test fixture and an unit test are linked in the PR.
NOTE : Nuxt TS community is growing, we already have a bunch of developers who will be ready to test this support using nuxt-edge if this proposal gets accepted and merged 😇

 Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)

Description
This PR follows #4557.
Instead of creating an issue, I wanted to prove that the @babel/preset-typescript is buggy with .vue files so I updated a test with a common TypeScript behavior. Check the CI pipeline, something went wrong ! Shortcut to the failed build 😉
A solution will be provided in the next commits and this description will be updated.
Solution which will be implemented : Replace the @babel/preset-typescript setup by a ts-loader setup. Please check (vuejs/vue-cli#2371 (comment)) and also (https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader#appendtsxsuffixto-regexp-default)
Resolves #4361

The previous behaviour was to return resolvedPath if the file exists
(even if it's a dir). After this change we first check for index files
in the dir, if there's not we still return the resolvedPath for the dir.

We use the IntersectionObserver if available, otherwise we document it to explain how to use Polyfill (see nuxt/docs#1068). When a <nuxt-link> is detected within the viewport, we prefetch the linked page to it (thanks to Webpack code-splitting <3).
A no-prefetch prop is also introduced to specify a <nuxt-link> to not automatically prefetch the page (it won't be observed as well).
The usage of destroyed hook let us free the observer as well as when the page is already prefetched, so the performances are really good. 🚀
Like quicklink, we check is the user internet connection is fast enough (and online) to request the splitted-page file, we also keep observing the links so when she keeps navigating and her internet connection change, it could preload the link 😄
It also introduce the way of splitting components for both client & server to optimize bundle size (nuxt-link.client.js and nuxt-link.server.js), this way, the server component does not rely on the IntersectionObserver. When a use disable this smart prefetching feature globally router.prefetchLinks: false, we directly use the nuxt-link.server.js component on the client-bundle to reduce the bundle size 🔥
This PR also introduce $nuxt.isOnline and $nuxt.isOffline so users can directly rely on it for their Vue components (these props are reactive), a little Christmas gift 🎁.

The idea is from @Atinux , use .server.js or .client.js to automatically detect server/client side plugin.

introduce mode: 'client|server' in plugin options
deprecate ssr in plugin options and use mode: 'client|server' instead, for now auto adapt ssr: false to mode: 'client' and show deprecating log.
apply server/client plugin on file ext like: server.js or client.js (specified options has higher priority)

Description
This PR improves Nuxt TS support by adding a build option useForkTschecker that enable type checking thanks to fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin.
Type checking makes you able to know if there is TS related errors within your code, which means that without it you may have Nuxt Webpack compilation succeed, but the errors only reported at runtime and not in an elegant way.
The type checker will check your code each time you make changes. In other terms, it's trigerred after each new Webpack compilation.
Usage
// nuxt.config.js
export default {
  build: {
    useForkTsChecker: true
  }
}
useForkTsChecker can either be a boolean or an object. If it's an object, it will override the plugin options
// nuxt.config.js
export default {
  build: {
    useForkTsChecker: {
      silent: true,
      tslint: false
    }
  }
}
Example of an error reported by the type checker

Project requirements to use this feature
The fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin is used/enabled only if the user project meets these requirements :

useForkTsChecker option is enabled (true) in the Nuxt configuration file
ts-loader is configured with the transpileOnly mode (to not have double type checkers)
fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin (and also tslint) devDependencies are installed

If the two first rules are fulfilled but not the latter, a warning will let you know that your project is missing the dependencies required :

Documentation
Documentation related to this PR will come later as a whole TS support documentation.

Since Node.js v8.0.0, a new utility function util.promisify() is available. It converts a callback-based function to a Promise-based one. So the pify dependency become useless.

 New feature (a non-breaking change which adds functionality)

Description



First prototype of ignore features.
Related: nuxt/rfcs#21

deprecate current ignore and ignorePrefix (Maybe in 3.0 ?), then support node-glob-gitignore
 same rules as .gitignore/.eslintignore
 support .nuxtignore file under srcDir
 support ignore pages/layouts to be ignored
 support store
 support middleware
 support plugin This is unnecessary since plugin is already bundled on demand
 watch .nuxtignore in dev mode

Breaking Changes

Several (mostly deprecated) options have been removed or renamed (#​2293, #​2409):

banner -> output.banner
dest -> output.file
entry -> input
experimentalCodeSplitting -> now always active
experimentalDynamicImport -> now always active
experimentalPreserveModules -> preserveModules
exports -> output.exports
extend -> output.extend
footer -> output.footer
format -> output.format
freeze -> output.freeze
globals -> output.globals
indent -> output.indent
interop -> output.interop
intro -> output.intro
load -> use plugin API
moduleName -> output.name
name -> output.name
noConflict -> output.noConflict
output.moduleId -> output.amd.id
outro -> output.outro
paths -> output.paths
preferConst -> output.preferConst
pureExternalModules -> treeshake.pureExternalModules
resolveExternal -> use plugin API
resolveId -> use plugin API
sourcemap -> output.sourcemap
sourceMap -> output.sourcemap
sourceMapFile -> output.sourcemapFile
strict -> output.strict
targets -> use output as an array
transform -> use plugin API
useStrict -> output.strict


In general, output options can no longer be used as input options (#​2409)
bundle.generate and bundle.write now return a new format (#​2293)
Several plugin hooks have become deprecated and will display warnings when used (#​2409):

transformBundle
transformChunk
ongenerate
onwrite


Plugin transform dependencies are deprecated in favour of the watchChange plugin hook (#​2409)
Accessing this.watcher in plugin hooks is deprecated in favour of the watchChange plugin hook (#​2409)
Using dynamic import statements will by default create a new chunk unless inlineDynamicImports is used (#​2293)
Rollup now uses acorn@6 which means that acorn plugins must be compatible with this version; acorn is now external for non-browser builds to make plugins work (#​2293)

Features

The --dir ClI option can now be aliased as -d (#​2293)
The --input option now supports named entry points via = (#​2293)

Bug Fixes

Both the --input option as well as the default CLI option now support named inputs (#​2293)

Description



Approval job won't be successful until it's approved manually, so the job of commits which don't need to be released will never be passed in dev branch.
I think it may be better to auto release the commits which include [release] in commit message.

 Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)

Description



This PR implements @clarkdo idea (#4645 (comment)) for standalone build mode and resolves #4645.
The build.standalone option is turned off by default to prevent any behaviour/breaking changes.
Benchmarks

Tested on bare-bone hello-world
Cold start time is measured using the production build of nuxt. From reading config until nuxt.ready()
Built on windows (Yeah I'm using windows again :P)

Normal build:

Size of server.js: 22 Kib
Cost of dependencies (vue, vue-router,  lodash (/omit), vue-no-ssr, debug): 7.4M
Cold start: 306.385ms
Memory usage: 29.9 MB (RSS: 106 MB)

Standalone build:

Size of server.js:  145 Kib
cold start: 306.550ms
Memory usage: 28.6 MB (RSS: 106 MB)

Results prove that there should be no big runtime diffs with the standalone mode. Still, we need to benchmark nuxt against real-world projects to decide on the default value.
Remarks

This is strange what dependency adds lodash/omit to the server bundle. Standalone build tree shakes only needed parts but should be still addressed
We need to announce users to use nuxt build --standalone when they need to use it with nuxt-start.

Alternative: For now we can add dependencies again to the nuxt-start distribution but it makes package bigger again
