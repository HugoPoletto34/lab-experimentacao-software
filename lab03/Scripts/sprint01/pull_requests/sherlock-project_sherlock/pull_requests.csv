Overview
Currently: The 75 HTTP requests run synchronously (one after the other). This means that each request must finish before the next one can be made.
With this PR: All HTTP requests are made in their own threads. Even though each request still blocks each thread, all threads are run in parallel. This allows for all requests to make progress at the same time, resulting in a ~2x performance increase.
Benchmarks
Updated on 12/30/18, as stated in this comment
Currently: 1.94s user, 1.50s system, 50% cpu, 40.5665 seconds
With this PR: 1.89s user 1.75s system 95% cpu 3.50564 seconds
This is a massive improvement (as expected)!
Notes

For this type of I/O task, asynchronous programming would have been much better solution than concurrent programming. However, python does not have great support for asynchronous programs. Some asynchronous libraries I tried using required Microsoft Build Tools as a dependency on windows, so I decided to keep the project ""simple to install"" and did not rely on such libraries. If anyone knows of a simple asynchronous programming library in python (that does not require native dependencies), please let me know!
Sometimes HTTP requests fail and throw an exception in the program. This is not an issue with my changes in this PR, and this issue can be fixed my merging PR #1",5,11

Overview

Exposes metrics about each request's response time (in milliseconds)
In verbose mode, prints out response times to console

Understanding the Metrics
Please note that long ""response times"" are not entirely the fault of the websites we make requests to. These response times are highly influenced by a variety of factors on your computer, such as Context Switching. All requests run in separate threads, but access to the network card for I/O is blocked to one request at a time. Therefore, some responses might be ""done"" earlier than your CPU can process them.
This needs to be tested and understood further (I plan on doing that later). So this PR only exposes these metrics, but doesn't take any actions on them or imply that long response times correlated to the website.
Implementation Details
I was able to make use of requests-futures' built-in hooks API to compute the response times. This allows each background thread to compute its own response time, so the main thread doesn't have to schedule time for that. Therefore, this introduces very little overhead!
Specific changes

Created ElapsedFuturesSession that records start, end, and elapsed time for each request in the background thread
Abstracted printing success/error to a function, making it more modular

Testing Done

Ensured this feature introduces minimal overhead by timing total running time of Sherlock. Did not notice any visible differences.
Ensured response times are printed in verbose mode
Ensured response times are NOT printed in quiet mode
Ensured response times are always exported to the CSV (in csv mode)

User Experience
With this PR, the following is displayed to the user in verbose mode. Note the inclusion of the response times in the second brackets per line.

Future Work
All response times are stored in the results_total and results_site dictionaries (in both quiet and verbose modes). This stored information can be post-processed to output metrics, such as:

Sites which took the longest to response
min, max, p50, p90, p99 response times
Expected timeouts for responses

I will create issues for this features when needed.",3,0

I came across your project and was interested to get started helping out.
Here I submitted a pull request from my fork of sherlock to segregate the application into small modules and make it a little more modular, I noticed it's a huge steer, however I think it would be a great idea.
If you do accept my pull request, may I suggest appending this commit into a separate branch.
Changes:

Creation of a sherlock folder
SherlockData class
SherlockLog class
SherlockService class

SherlockData class:
Creating an instance of this class loads the data.json or any other json files as a configuration for the SherlockService class.
SherlockLog class:
Initializing Logging activities and keeping track of activities.  The class committed only contain error, log and info methods for printing to the stdout using the color package.
SherlockService class:
A unique SherlockService which performs asynchronous requests to HTTP and HTTPS web server using requests and grequests.

Changes in this pull request

Add a fixed timeout to all requests (currently set to 10s)
Note: In my tests, 10s was enough even with Tor. Sometimes a site may take longer to respond, but a longer timeout will make the script takes to much time (waiting + retries) and the retries will usually handle intermittent connections.
Change Flipboard unclaimed username
Add a tests/.excluded_sites list to allow pass tests for unresponsive sites

a3c105a sherlock takes a Firefox User-Agent when we send a request by default. However, Twitter started to detect the page request to see whether it supports javascript or not. The User-Agent makes it consider sherlock as a browser and redirect us to a prompt page. The solution is to set the User-Agent as an empty string. And Twitter gives a 404 if an account does not exist.
0d4eb59 Telegram redirects us to the home page if we prompt a non-existing account.
786583f Insanejournal responds us a 404 for an invalid username.

This is just a first iteration, it should already work without breaking any existing functionality. You're welcome to give feedback though if you feel I'd done something wrong.
Main Changes

Adds Anilist back in to data.json. (For testing the implementation of this PR.)
Adds an interpolate_string function, because I thought it would be nicer if we could define the request_payload as JSON rather than as a string literal. Opinion welcome!
Allow data.json to specify the request method, defaulting to HEAD/GET based on the errorType if not specified.
Replaces the now redundant ""request_head_only"": false with ""request_method"": ""GET""

Queries
This replaces the use of .format with .replace which might be unfavorable, but I wasn't sure of what the best way to go about this was.

.format throws an exception if there is no {} in the string. This can be annoying since we may want to insert the username into the url, probeUrl, or request_payload. But different websites do things differently, some will want the username in the url, others might want it in the request_payload, so one of them will throw an exception. This is avoided with .replace.
I think it'd be a better developer/user experience if the request_payload was an object rather than a string, so the interpolate_string function would want to use .replace in this case anyway since many of the keys may not require templating.

After going through the issue, I tried checking for some popular onlyfans creators on sherlock and as per the issue raised all of them were giving false negative.
So, I checked with the current method of checking the username availability. It the following API url:
https://onlyfans.com/api2/v2/users/grandmasterchefjojo
It returns a 400 error code and doesn't work at all.
Why it's happening? It requires a token be passed in the headers to for it to work.
After this, I tried using BurpSuite to find any other way to check availability and unfortunately there aren't any.
Even the wrong onlyfans.com/thisusernamedoesntexist777 URL also returns 200 in HTTP response.
So, it's better to remove OnlyFans from supported sites list and add it to removed_sites.json
