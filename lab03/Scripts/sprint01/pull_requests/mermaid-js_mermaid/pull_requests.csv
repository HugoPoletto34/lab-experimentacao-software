Chrome is faster and more stable than PhantomJS. And it doesn't eat memory like crazy.


I don't see any future in developing PhantomJS. Developing PhantomJS 2 and 2.5 as a single developer is a bloody hell.

We will get rid of PhantomJS altogether in the future.
Get rid of browserify
Now there is no browserify. I replaced karma-browserify with karma-webpack.
Remove some useless code and libraries
gulp-uglify was removed because webpack has embedded uglify support.
jshint was remove because now we are using JavaScript Standard Style based on ESLint
Removed some gulp tasks because we no longer need them.
Add some documentation for contributors to readme

I'm using mermaid for a new site that I'm making that will be highly focused on software design.  However, there were two features that didn't work as I expected, so I changed them.  I'm submitting a PR here in case you want the changes too.

Firstly, there was hard-coded CSS setting the font to whatever was auto-detected in the browser.  This is fairly fragile.  I don't know why it was added, but it's probably an edge case or a ""compatibility"" thing.  I don't think anyone would expect this sort of feature, and it was surprising.

It was also causing problems when the font loads slowly on the page, randomly.  It also failed if I did anything different with font-size.  I really recommend leaving the users alone with their choice of font.  üòÅ

The classes were mixed up or missing from the UML diagrams.  I fixed this, and now everything looks great.

Also: I noticed that some of the features being tested in the UML diagrams don't actually do anything, but they're also not failing.  I'm guessing they were features that aren't finished yet?   Can I help?",5,4

I've added the possibility to mark tasks in a Gantt chart as milestones.
What this does is the following:

It makes the rect representing the task exactly square, with both sides being the theBarHeight
It changes the x-coordinate, so that the rect is smack in the middle of what would have been the rectangular representing the task.
It adjusts the position of the text label accordingly
It adds a class to both the rect and the text label
The scss rotates the square, and scales it down slightly so that it looks like a diamond, which seems to be the standard icon for milestones
the scss makes the text label italics

It's backwards compatible, so if the milestone tag isn't there, it should work as expected.
Milestones with a task duration of several days don't really make sense, but it would still work. You just get a lot of  padding to the left and right. This also happens when the timescale is very wide, like so:",5,5

After researching this issue I agreed with Dunning-Kruger that it seemed prudent to support passing in the node identifier as the callback parameter as a solution. I then found that the project already supports this for flowcharts. Gantt charts, on the other hand, already support passing in custom parameters to a callback function. This, however, was not reflected in the documentation.

This PR adds a GitHub action that analyzes current cypress.io tests and shows a nice overview of them. When a test is added / skipped / removed this analyzer shows it in a comment.
When a PR is created with a test a new label ""has tests"" is added

Design Decisions
This works as GitHub action on each PR, and compares changes with base branch. Then cypress/integration tests are statically analyzed for changes and a comment is added to PR.

This is a one line fix for a bug where there's an infinite loop when adjusting a date range that ends with a date of the 31st. The problem was that startTime.date() could never exceed endTime.date() when endTime.date() was the 31st. The code would continue to increment startTime indefinitely, causing the page to freeze.
Resolves #1060
üìè Design Decisions
Instead of the while loop being conditional on comparing the days of the month (i.e. 1, 2, .. 30, 31), it compares the full date object, including the month and year.

In graphlib edges have an ID that is constructed from the nodes being linked plus an (optional) name. If two edges are provided with the same nodes and name (or no name at all) then they overwrite each other. Mermaid's class diagram parser already collected the relations correctly but added them without name. I'm now using the relation label as a natural choice for the edges name. This fixes the problem.

Please first take a look at PR #1314 , it contains a fix for multiline messages in sequence diagrams.
This PR is an additional improvement which let the user set the alignment of these multiline messages.
It introduces a new configuration option messageAlign which takes 3 possible values:

left: align text to the left
center (default): text is align in the middle, current alignment
right: align text to the right

üìè Design Decisions
To left/right align the text, I change the style attribute text-anchor and I move the center alignment line according to the maximum width of text lines.
üì∑ Example
Here is a basic HTTP request/response diagram where text alignment is useful:

‚ÅâÔ∏è Why two PRs ?
The first PR #1314  is IMHO easier (no additional parameter, no change in flow or logic). This one require a new parameter and a double iteration is mandatory to calculate max text width.

Alters the syntax for newly implemented ER diagrams so that it is compatible with PlantUML ERD syntax
Resolves #1309
üìè Design Decisions
A fairly straight-forward change to the jison parsing logic to use different syntax for specifying relationships between entities.  For example, the original syntax I implemented for an one-to-many was EntityA !-?< EntityB : label and the new syntax for this is EntityA ||--o{ EntityB : label.
The : label part is an extension to PlantUML, because it is very convenient/common to label relationships.
Also PlantUML syntax allows the distinction between identifying and non-identifying relationships which I hadn't previously implemented.  This is now supported by using either hyphens or dots in the middle part of the relationship specifier.  Hyphens are rendered as a s solid line, whereas dots are rendered as a dashed line.  The docs have been updated to give a better overview.

Fix viewBox mapping to svg viewport to prevent left-most edges being sliced off in some cases
Resolves #1327
üìè Design Decisions
A change to the way the viewBox is defined in flowRenderer.js.  It now uses svgBounds.x and svgBounds.y to determine its minimum x and y values respectively (with an adjustment for padding around the diagram).  This is instead of using (0,0), because it is possible for unlabelled edges to have negative co-ordinates which meant that they got 'sliced' off.  The viewBox now correctly maps onto the svg viewport even if the latter has negative minima.
Also, a new integration test has been added to include an example equivalent to that provided by the bug reporter so that this case is included in regression tests.

üìè Design Decisions
The diagram is split into as many sections as requested. Each section contains tasks, tasks have scores and actors. The score indicates how happy the user is at having to perform the task. Typically you'd hope that once UI/UX design had been implemented the scores on each step of the task would increase.

This commit fixes some bugs, and I believe, improves upon the current
implementation.
Resolves #494
üìè Design Decisions
Mermaid is awesome - I use it a lot (it's even more awesome w/ emacs & ob-mermaid);
and that's why I think that we should make a few improvements to the sequence diagram rendering.
I think that it falls short, compared to other diagram types, in that it renders rectangles with a fixed size, as opposed to dynamically scaling them when, for instance, the text is larger than the container.
There are workaround, of course - one can set a larger width for the rectangles - that yield an awkward result though, b/c all rectangles are rendered with the same width;
and we'd probably like to have the ability to have a sole rectangle that should be bigger, and others that should be smaller.
The following is a list of proposed fixes that I believe would make the usage of sequence diagrams better:

Control over note font size, family and alignment (now defaults to
center)
Dynamic actor resizing - actor's width will now scale if its
description is bigger than the static configured width
Dynamic actor margins - the margin between actors will now be
dynamically calculated by taking into account the width of connecting
messages or notes
Fixed a small visual annoyance where a loop arrow would intersect
with the text it loops on
Fixed a bug where if global config -> fontFamily wasn't defined, it
would override the actorFontFamily with an undefined
Removed some stale / commented out code
Added missing config variables to the global config object in mermaidAPI.js
Fixed doc strings for methods which had an outdated one
Added e2e tests for the above scenarios
Added documentation for the new config keys
Linted the sequence diagram markdown doc
Refactored a bit where necessary

All tests pass - and looking at the generated dist/index.html, with some additional use cases, looks pretty good.

Change the fontSize config from a string to an integer to prevent NaN errors
Resolves #1362
üìè Design Decisions
This was a simple fix - the original code expressed the fontSize option for ERDs (in mermaidAPI.js) as a string, for example '12px'.  But during positioning and sizing of nodes this value was used in simple arithmetic (e.g. to add padding).  In fact that code itself was not necessary because the position and sizing of nodes is taken care of elsewhere, however the attempt to add a string to a padding factor was causing NaN errors during rendering.  These errors were not fatal, and rendering worked anyway, but the errors needed to be sorted.  This was as  simple as:

Change the config option to an integer in mermaidAPI.js (which is consistent with other diagram types)
Change a few lines of code in the renderer to get rid of the unnecessary padding calculation
Change a couple of lines of code in the renderer to add the 'px' suffix to the style attribute of entity names and relationship labels

Replace import * from 'd3'; with explicit (named) imports across all source files
Resolves #1390
üìè Design Decisions
For the most part the changes are trivial - just have to:

import only the objects needed, and
remove the d3. prefix from the object references (mostly function invocations)

But there are 2 points worth highlighting:


In a couple of places a variable was declared with the same name as a d3 function, for example one might find a statement like const arc = d3.arc().startAngle(...), then a  bit later a reference to the newly created arc constant.  But doing an explicit import of the arc() function, then removing the d3. prefix, causes a name clash between the constant and the function.  I chose to alias the imported function (I could have changed the name of the const instead), so that the above line becomes const arc = d3arc().startAngle(...).


In src\utils.js it was necessary to create an ""enum"" of the d3 curve types so that they could be associatively referenced in the interpolateToCurve function.  This is because removing the import * from 'd3'; statement meant there was no object named 'd3' in scope, and this was being used as an associative array in the said function.  The solution was simply to create a (much smaller) object containing the imported function names so that it could be referenced instead.

Added an auto-wrap option for (non 2.x svg text) sequence diagram notes, messages, actor descriptions, etc.

More than a couple tweaks and fixes.
Special thanks to Carys Mills @ https://medium.com/@CarysMills/wrapping-svg-text-without-svg-2-ecbfb58f7ba4 for the basis fro the wrapLabels and breakWords logic.
I have not added all of the unit-tests necessary for me to feel comfortable with this PR yet. I wanted to get eyeballs on this earlier rather than later. Once I finish up the unit tests on my local I'll change this to a formal PR.
üìè Design Decisions
I wanted auto-wrapping in svg text so my sequence diagrams looked like this:

and not like this:

I updated the parser logic to properly support automatic wrapping of notes, messages, and actor descriptions. The margins are respected.
Enabling autowrapping requires nothing more than this:
sequenceDiagram
  %%wrap
  participant a as aa
  participant b as bb
  participant c as cc

  a->>+b: Hello
  b->>-a: World
  a->>+c: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Curabitur at felis vel justo semper rhoncus. Morbi in ipsum facilisis, dictum lorem luctus, accumsan ligula. Etiam et auctor nisi, ac cursus mauris. Ut finibus nunc ante, vitae tempus magna pharetra eu.

Incidentally, initialization ala mermaid.initialize(...) is now available within the text block as well:
%%initialize: { 'logLevel': 0, 'theme': 'dark' }
sequenceDiagram
  %%config: { 'fontFamily':'.SF NS','fontSize':14,'fontWeight':400 }
  %%wrap
  participant a as aa
  participant b as bb
  participant c as cc

  a->>+b: Hello
  b->>-a: World
  a->>+c: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Curabitur at felis vel justo semper rhoncus. Morbi in ipsum facilisis, dictum lorem luctus, accumsan ligula. Etiam et auctor nisi, ac cursus mauris. Ut finibus nunc ante, vitae tempus magna pharetra eu.

It doesn't matter what quotes you use, I change them to """" to make the json proper anyway. The only requirement is: you need to make the json well-formed or you'll have very little showing up on the page. (Read: JSON parsing errors). Also, you can use %%initialize or %%init. Also, %%config, %%conf, %%configuration, and %%configure all work equally too.
Location kinda matters for the %%initialize statement; just like sequenceDiagram. The init statement must be first (if it exists at all). wrap can be anywhere as it is more of a directive than a statement. Once it is found, all of the relevant texts will be wrapped where necessary.
EDIT: I‚Äôve changed init, initialize, conf, config, configure, configuration, and wrap to be effectively directives. As far as I could tell, directives didn‚Äôt exist in the grammar but seem to be parser-friendly as well as backwards-compatible. This is a plus in my opinion.",2,7

Slight refactor for sequenceDiagram db/renderer

Fixed default configuration woes introduced by yours-truly with the directives feature (built on fixes Knut added for this same issue)
Added freeze to mermaidAPI to protect a new exported defaultConfig
Enhanced reset to revert any modifications to the current config back to the defaultConfig
Enhanced initialize to merge user config into mermaidAPI current config without losing the defaultConfig
Enhanced initialize to update each renderer config
Enhanced init/initialize directive to support a universal 'config' property which will be changed (based on detectType) to the proper config-object-name for the graph type in scope. Example:

%%{init: { 'config': {'wrapEnabled': true }}}%%
sequenceDiagram
participant Alice

will correctly set the config property of the initialization object to sequence effectively resulting in the following object to be sent to mermaidAPI.initialize()
{
  'sequence': {
    'wrapEnabled': true
  }
}

which, when combined with the new assignWithDepth functionality will properly update the current config of the mermaidAPI (without losing other defaults) as well as updating the sequenceRenderer config

Directives have been reworked a little

Now any graph type can include a %%{init: { 'config': {..}}}%% directive and their config will correctly be converted to the properly-named config for the graph they are describing without losing the default config in the process.
User configuration is now overlaid properly on top of default config


Moved a fair number of common functions to utils.js

wrapLabel - breaks a label(text) into a '' delimited string for wrapping long strings
calculateTextDimensions - calculate the width, height of a block of text (taking into account linebreaks)
drawSimpleText - function lifted from sequence/svgDraw.js for drawing a simple text/tspan via svg (used primarily for calculating text dimensions)
drawText - lifted from sequenceRenderer and modified slightly to handle text with or without linebreaks and render the text properly.
assignWithDepth - new function to expand on Object.assign for use with merging config (taking into account arbitrary object graph depth)


Enhanced sequenceDiagram rendering to support wrapping on loop types

The loop/opt/alt/par description text now wraps properly (if wrapEnabled is true)


Fixed an odd issue with sequence diagrams where useMaxWidth was not properly using the max width
Many new unit tests for all of the above

If i missed a test please let me know. I tried to be thorough.

It's a little hard to style the current ERDs. This aims to make things easier by associating a distinct class with each type of element within the diagram.
üìè Design Decisions

I've added a common er class across the elements so that those that bring their own themeCSS can target styles at this diagram type. This hasn't really been done elsewhere so I'm open to suggestions; an alternative may be to add classes to a top-level element so that we can do e.g. svg.mermaid.er .entityBox.

Fixed a config issue where multiple diagrams on the same page (using the same mermaid context) would inadvertently share the same configuration if the first config utilized the init directive to set configuration variables.

The jison parsing statements for directive support are fairly drop-in and require very little change on the parser. These changes have been added and the modifications to the parserDb support file have been made for the following diagrams:

There is currently no way of influencing the length of (i.e. the number of ranks spanned by) a particular link in a flowchart. A workaround that uses invisible nodes has been proposed in #637. This PR provides an extension of the edge syntax that enables users to request a minimum length for any edge. The length of an edge can be extended by adding extra characters in its definition, as follows:



Length
1
2
3




Normal
---
----
-----


Normal with arrow
-->
--->
---->


Thick
===
====
=====


Thick with arrow
==>
===>
====>


Dotted
-.-
-..-
-...-


Dotted with arrow
-.->
-..->
-...->



Note that this is change backwards compatible, because the syntax for length-1 edges coincides with the existing syntax which already generated length-1 edges. This feature leverages the minlen option exposed by Dagre which was not previously available when using Mermaid.
Resolves #637, resolves #1495.
üìè Design Decisions
The Jison grammar for edges was refactored to avoid handling each combination of edge and arrow types separately. This makes the implementation of the new feature simpler and facilitates the addition of new edge and arrow types. The destructLink and destructStartLink parsing functions were modified accordingly.
A length attribute, containing the length of each parsed edge, is added their internal representation. This attribute‚Äôs value is passed down to Dagre in the renderer via the minlen option.

Multiple notes in state diagrams do not work when using the ""note [...] end note"" notation. Parser will only recognize the very last ""end note"" and will put everything in between into 1 note.

Add the option to choose if the node ids should be determinist or not.
I have added 3 different options:

not deterministic (based on Date.now) like right now in the code (is the default)

starts at the length of a given string (like requested here: mermaidjs/mermaid.cli#85)

The options can be set as deterministicIds (boolean, default is false)
and deterministicIDSeed (as the optional seed)

I understand that unique ids based on the Date.now are desired in many cases but as soon as files get checked into git, this turns out to be a design flaw of mermaid. So overriding this in such cases would be a nice option.

Added a link to the google docs integration of mermaid
The plugin is free and open source at https://github.com/renanlecaro/mermaid-gdocs
It lets you create a diagram, insert it in any google document, then edit it later.
It uses the alt description of the image to store the source of the diagram.
It hotlinks to the latest version of mermaid, to avoid having to update it every time a new version is published

We've frequently discovered while using mermaid issues with the allowed class names.  We work in Ruby, so not being able to have a double colon (""::"") in our class names is a big blocker to switching to mermaid.

I have also reduced the number of shift/reduce conflicts in the parser without breaking any test cases.  In order to avoid introducing more conflicts in the future I have also added a test that counts the number of conflicts.  It won't remove all the existing conflicts from the mainline branch, but it will make sure new ones are not introduced without being detected.

this is a continuation of the fix I introduced in #1935 and now that the latest cli was released, I was able to use it in production examples, but I ran into yet another problem ...
üìè Design Decisions
it seems, that after compiling / minification, the initIdGenerator method, produces corrupted behaviour, due to the nature of how it's originally written (a function that returns a class instance)
here's the result of the compiled / minified output:

note the line:
for (var a, o = H.initIdGeneratior(r.deterministicIds, r.deterministicIDSeed).next, s = function (r) {
by declaring the variable o as o = H.initIdGeneratior(r.deterministicIds, r.deterministicIDSeed).next the context of this is lost when later called o() and thus the counter in the original class is pointing to a non-existing property....
this is not an issue in the source code, but rather the babel compiled result so this wasn't captured in any tests for that reason...
all this resulted in Cannot read property 'count' of undefined when deterministicIds = true
I re-wrote the function call very simply to keep the same original code structure without having to do a major re-write of anything else inter-connected or related...
I then ran build and minify steps and manually replaced the mermaid.min.js file manually at node_modules/@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli/mermaid.min.js and tested the CLI to confirm no further issues. (and confirmed that deterministicIds are in fact working)

Release notes
Sourced from actions/setup-node's releases.

Support caching dependencies and LTS aliases
This release brings two major features:

[Support LTS aliases #270](actions/setup-node#270)
[Implementation of node's caching #272](actions/setup-node#272)

Supported version syntax
The node-version input supports the following syntax:
major versions: 12, 14, 16
more specific versions: 10.15, 14.2.0, 16.3.0
nvm LTS syntax: lts/erbium, lts/fermium, lts/*
Caching dependencies
The action has a built-in functionality for caching and restoring npm/yarn dependencies. Supported package managers are npm, yarn. The cache input is optional, and caching is turned off by default.
Caching npm dependencies:
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
- uses: actions/setup-node@v2
  with:
    node-version: '14'
    cache: 'npm'
- run: npm install
- run: npm test
Caching yarn dependencies:
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
- uses: actions/setup-node@v2
  with:
    node-version: '14'
    cache: 'yarn'
- run: yarn install
- run: yarn test
Yarn caching handles both yarn versions: 1 or 2.

At the moment, only lock files in the project root are supported.

v2.1.5 Release
Improve error and warning line number handling (problem matcher regex)
v2.1.4
The first stable release of actions/setup-node V2
v2.1.3 (beta)

Add support for specifying architecture of Node.JS

Support data flow diagrams by adding brackets [| and |] for datastore nodes to graph, e.g.

Resolves #1893
üìè Design Decisions
I extend graph as data flow diagrams are graphs in general. However, the same grammar is used for flowchart, which does not contain such nodes. I use the brackets [| and |] as suggested by the author of the issue. However, if other nodes may be added in the future that are rectangles with borders/strokes on specific sides, the | indicates rather vertical lines than horizontal. We might consider [- and -] instead. Actually, we could support all sides using brackets:

[| left, but no top stroke
[|- left and top stroke
[- no left, but top stroke
|] right, but no bottom stroke
-|] right and bottom stroke
-] no right, but bottom stroke

However, this would be a larger change/extension of the grammar. Hence, I only added one bracket pair, which is sufficient to cover data flow diagrams. What do you think?

Release notes
Sourced from concurrently's releases.

v7.0.0
üéâ  ü•Ç  Happy 2022!
Breaking changes

Dropped support for Node 10. Minimum version is now 12.20.
concurrently() API now has a different return value. Please refer to the docs.

Functional changes

Added --group flag/option to run process in parallel but print output in sequence - #75, #79, #272
Codebase converted to TypeScript. Some bugs may arise due to this, but I hope not!

API Changes

concurrently can now be imported as an ES Module! Just do import concurrently from 'concurrently'.
concurrently() now returns the commands alongside a promise for the result - #209

New Contributors

@‚Äãcdrini made their first contribution in open-cli-tools/concurrently#272
