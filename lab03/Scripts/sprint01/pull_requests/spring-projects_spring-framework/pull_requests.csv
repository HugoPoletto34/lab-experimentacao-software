Specify a valid version of servlet container explicitly (3.1+).
Change to use the LinkedHashMap instead of HashMap. The LinkedHashMap can be keep order of items. (I think more better that use LinkedHashMap in sample code)
Change a JSON format(indent , white-space). In addition, this format is same with indentOutput of Jackson.

I have signed and agree to the terms of the Spring ICLA.
Thanks.",4,1
