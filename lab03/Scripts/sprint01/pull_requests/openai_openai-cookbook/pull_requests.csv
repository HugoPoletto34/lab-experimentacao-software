Description
This pull request introduces enhancements and refactoring to the Code_search.ipynb notebook, which contains methods for extracting Python functions and generating text embeddings. The proposed modifications not only make the code more efficient and user-friendly, but also ease the process of future maintenance.
Included Updates


Normalization of File Paths: In the current implementation, file path normalization is done using string.replace(). This approach produces inconsistent results and may potentially replace substrings not part of the root directory. To address this issue, I've updated the code to utilize the relative_to() method from the pathlib.Path module. This method accurately computes relative paths, considering the file structure, and ensures correct results in scenarios when the base directory name appears multiple times in the path. Please refer to the example below for a better understanding of the differences between the two approaches.
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path

data = {'file_path': [
    'repo/main/src/file1_copy/other/repo/main/src/file1',
    'repo/main/src/file1_copy/file1',
]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Approach 1: Path.relative_to()
root_dir = Path('repo/main/src')
df['Path.relative_to()'] = df['file_path'].map(lambda x: Path(x).relative_to(root_dir))

# Approach 2: string.replace()
root_dir = 'repo/main/src'
df['str.replace()'] = df['file_path'].apply(lambda x: x.replace(root_dir, ''))

Path.relative_to()
string.replace()

Capture async def: Updated the file searching logic to extract both regular def and asynchronous async def methods. This modification enables a more robust extraction of Python functions and ensures that async methods are not excluded from the analysis.


Refactor get_functions: Refactored function to handle files using a context manager to improve safety and resiliency.


Refactor get_until_no_space: Update logic to prevent potential index out of range errors.


Improve Directory Search: Update code to use pathlib.Path.glob() to search for files vs. the original os.walk() and glob() methods. The os.walk() method traverses the directory tree recursively, generating a tuple for each directory it encounters. The pathlib.Path.glob() method performs the file search directly, without generating intermediate results. This can lead to improved performance, as the search is more efficient and consumes less memory.


Implement extract_functions_from_repo: Encompasses the logic of code file function extraction and printing.


These changes collectively enhance the functionality and maintainability of the script, providing better support for future development and analysis tasks involving the openai-cookbook repository.

Rationale:

The tiktoken FAQ recommends Tiktokenizer as a resource, in the first line under ""Usage help"". Besides indicating that it is a helpful resource, this also suggests that OpenAI is already willing to direct users to it.
Tiktokenizer supports some important encodings the OpenAI Tokenizer currently does not, such as cl100k_base. This allows users to see how text is tokenized for chat models like gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4, and for the embedding model text-embedding-ada-002. In contrast, the OpenAI Tokenizer currently only supports GPT-3 and Codex.

(I am not affiliated in any way with Tiktokenizer. I learned about it a while ago from the tiktoken FAQ, and I've often found it useful.)
I'm unsure what the best wording is here, but I phrased it ""or the third-party Tiktokenizer webapp"" to so no readers are misled into thinking Tiktokenizer is itself developed by OpenAI.",3,3

I'm excited to open this PR to add an example of support for using a database Tair as a datastore.
Tair is a cloud native in-memory database service that is developed by Alibaba Cloud. It is compatible with open source Redis and provides a variety of data models and enterprise-class capabilities to support real-time online scenarios. Tair also introduces persistent memory-optimized instances that are based on the new non-volatile memory (NVM) storage medium. These instances can reduce costs by 30%, ensure data persistence, and provide almost the same performance as in-memory databases. Tair has been widely used in areas such as government affairs, finance, manufacturing, healthcare, and pan-Internet to meet their high-speed query and computing requirements.
Tairvector is an in-house data structure that provides high-performance real-time storage and retrieval of vectors. TairVector provides two indexing algorithms: Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) and Flat Search. Additionally, TairVector supports multiple distance functions, such as Euclidean distance, inner product, and Jaccard distance. Compared with traditional vector retrieval services, TairVector has the following advantages:

Stores all data in memory and supports real-time index updates to reduce latency of read and write operations.
Uses an optimized data structure in memory to better utilize storage capacity.
Functions as an out-of-the-box data structure in a simple and efficient architecture without complex modules or dependencies.

Therefore, Tair is a good choice for vector storage.",2,6

Data Preparation: We use a subset of the SQuADv2 and get answers using OpenAI's GPT3.5-Turbo model. This serves as our baseline for performance comparison.


Evaluation Metrics: Wrote an Evaluation class to assess the performance of the initial RAG model on our dataset. This sets the stage for the fine-tuning process by providing a quantitative measure of the model's initial capabilities.


Fine-Tuning Setup: We convert the dataset into a JSONL format that's compatible with OpenAI's fine-tuning process and create a fine-tuning job, targeting improvements in the model's answer-generating capabilities.


Performance Comparison: After fine-tuning, we run the model on the same dataset and use the Evaluator again to quantify the improvements gained from fine-tuning. We see an error reduction from ~50% questions to ~10% questions
Documentation: The entire process is commented, aimed at aiding anyone looking to fine-tune OpenAI's RAG models.",2,1

This PR closes #743 by adding an article about function calling using the Node.js SDK. Given that the article is about JavaScript, and not Python, I wrote it as a .md file instead of as an .ipynb file, as I noticed other non-Python articles in the cookbook doing this as well.. Please let me know if you want me to use .ipynb instead.
In addition to the textual article, I have also recorded an interactive walk-through of the code. This will help learners who prefer watching videos over reading text.
Motivation
Almost all notebooks are based on Python. However, there are tons of JavaScript developers who use the OpenAI API as well. These people lack good tutorials, as exemplified by this post in the OpenAI community forum.

This notebook demonstrates a method to chain function calls together using a synthetic OpenAPI specification for a fictional ""froge"" character database. The OpenAPI spec was created using gpt-4. The spec is then transformed into a set of function definitions that can be supplied to the Chat completion API. We started by defining the user's instructions and the maximum number of chained function calls allowed. We then defined a function to get the model's response and another function to process the chained function calls

Adding fine tuning for function calling recipe. This generates synthetic data to improve the performance of function calling for a 'drone co-pilot ai'. The notebook shows how an untuned 3.5 Turbo fails to reject certain requests that the drone cannot do, and improperly calls functions. Then, the notebook creates invocations for every function, generates synthetic prompts that would lead to that invocation, and fine-tunes the model. The result is an improved model that properly rejects those questions.
Motivation
There is no notebook now on fine tuning for function calling, and this is a big customer need and ask.

This PR brings an updated ""Astra DB and Cassandra"" set of RAG demo notebooks, including adaptation to OpenAI v1.0, the usage of datasets instead of a local file for source data, revised graphics, a more consistent language, updated links in the references and, most notably, a brand new notebook showcasing usage of the HTTP API for Astra DB through usage of the ""astrapy"" client.
This newly-added notebook performs the same ""reference"" task as the other two (GenAI with RAG on the same data) but does so using a different tech stack, in the same ""choose-your-own-framework"" spirit pursued so far in this folder.
Motivation
Besides making the language more coherent when referring to Astra DB products and Apache Cassandra®, fixing a few typos and improving the images accordingly, there are major improvements/updates to these notebooks as follows:

code made to work with OpenAI v1.0+
reference links reflect the latest relevant readings for the user (e.g. the Cassandra website recently published a new page about its support for vector search)
using the datasets library instead of a local JSON file, which makes the colab experience less contrived and basically identical to the local-jupyter case

And of course DataStax is releasing a new database experience based on an HTTP API, which is what the newly-added notebook addresses.
Note
I did not advance the date listed on registry.yaml for the pre-existing cookbook notebooks, as I assumed these refer to the creation date and not the last-update. Feel free to let me know and I will change this if needed!

Then, we use DE3 to create an intro image for the presentation.
Motivation
This notebook showcases another use case of the Assistants API, and DALL-E3, and addresses a very common and laborious task that many professionals do: making slides. Hopefully it can save people a lot of time and motivate them to think of other ways to speed up more manual parts of their jobs.

Updates the """"question answering using embeddings""  example Jupyter notebook to use the current chat completions and embeddings methods
new form is
openai.chat.completions.create

There are corresponding changes required to parse the structures returned.
There are also incidental changes to the output text due to changes to ChatGPT and/or the non-deterministic nature of the openAPI text output for a given input.
I added a line to  explicitly set the API key from ENV variable, as that could help new users to get the example running.
All code has been run and all example output seems reasonable.
Motivation

Why are these changes necessary? How do they improve the cookbook?
The existing example only runs if you pin it to an obsolete version of the openai library.

Adds a cookbook example to store and query OpenAI embeddings in Supabase using pgvector and Supabase's auto-generated REST API. This guide is written for JavaScript developers, but also adds callouts that explain how they can modify it for other languages.
Motivation
Many Supabase customers use OpenAI embeddings in their DB (via pgvector) to perform semantic search and RAG over their data. This PR adds a guide that demonstrates exactly how to implement semantic search in Supabase using OpenAI embeddings while also following database best practices (like HNSW indexes, row level security, etc).
Supabase exposes an auto-generated REST API (based on the user's table schema), so this guide walks users through how to interact with their data via this API. There also aren't too many cookbook examples written for JavaScript developers, so this guide targets this audience and explains how to implement semantic search for multiple JavaScript runtimes (Node.js, Deno, Edge Functions). Since this focuses on JavaScript, the guide was written as mdx, but let me know if ipynb is preferred here!

Migrates all remaining V0.* calls to Open AI API V1.
Approach: The approach can be seen in these commits. It consists of 4 steps:

Create a helper script, ipynb_migration_helper.py
Use to ipynb_migration_helper.py extract all code cells from all notebooks. This is necessary because openai migration does not apply its migrations to .ipynb files.
Run openai migration which applies Grit's OpenAI V1 migrations to all the cells from the notebooks.
Remerge all migrated cells with ipynb_migration_helper.py using the command line option --reinsert
Delete all temporary files (extracted cell files) and the helper script.

Motivation
We have been migrating this repo to V1 piecemeal. This is because the openai migrate command and the migration tools provided by Grit that were referenced in the V1.0.0 migration guide do not support .ipynb files.
I have gone ahead and taken the approach outlined above, with the helper script to extract and reinsert cells, in order to take care of all remaining migrations in a scalable manner.
Testing
I have not tested each .ipynb notebook affected, but am rather relying on the correctness of the openai migrate command.
Squash and Merge
Maintainers: If you decide to merge this, please remember to Squash and Merge into a single commit, so the helper script and temporary files created by it will not become part of the record. (Apologies if I'm stating the obvious.)

This PR updates the Vector Database example in the Azure Search Cookbook to utilize the latest stable General Availability (GA) release of the Azure AI Search Python SDK. Additionally, it includes renaming instances of ""Azure Search"" to ""Azure AI Search"" to reflect the current branding and product naming conventions.
Motivation
The Azure Search Cookbook is a valuable resource for developers working with Azure AI Search. Keeping the cookbook examples up-to-date with the latest SDK ensures that users have access to the most current features and best practices. The rebranding from ""Azure Search"" to ""Azure AI Search"" aligns the cookbook with the official terminology, reducing confusion and improving searchability.

This notebook teaches developers to get started with the Assistants API using the Node.js SDK. It explains how to build a travel agent that utilizes both the code interpreter and knowledge retrieval tools.
In addition to the textual article, I have also recorded an interactive walk-through of the code. This will help learners who prefer watching videos over reading text.
Motivation
There are currently no tutorials in the cookbook that teach JavaScript developers to get started with the Assistants API. This PR fixes this.

This is a very minor change which updates the W&B Weave example notebook to use valid syntax.
Motivation
For context, there's a variable which they want the user to assign a value to e.g. FOO = # set a value but this is invalid syntax and could be confusing to some users. I've edited it to be  FOO = """" # set a value. I discovered this while attempting to include this project in Ruff's ecosystem checks at astral-sh/ruff#9293.
There is a minor chance that this would increase confusion as the notebook will no longer fail with a syntax error if the user does not set a value. It'd be trivial to add additional code that checks the value of the variable and raises an informative error if that's a concern. I am happy to do so, but wanted to start with the smaller changer.",2,1

Summary
This PR updates the comment to correctly reflect the use of GPT-4 in the code, replacing the outdated reference to text-davinci-003. The goal is to provide accurate documentation and eliminate any confusion regarding the model version used in the cookbook.
Motivation
Why are these changes necessary? How do they improve the cookbook?
The changes are necessary to maintain the accuracy and relevance of the documentation. By updating the comment to match the code, we ensure that users have a clear understanding of the model being used, which is crucial for replicating results and troubleshooting. This improvement enhances the overall usability and reliability of the cookbook.

The objective of this notebook is to demonstrate how to summarize large documents with a controllable level of detail. If you give a GPT model the task of summarizing a long document (e.g. 10k or more tokens), you'll tend to get back a relatively short summary that isn't proportional to the length of the document. For instance, a summary of a 20k token document will not be twice as long as a summary of a 10k token document. One way we can fix this is to split our document up into pieces, and produce a summary piecewise. After many queries to a GPT model, the full summary can be reconstructed. By controlling the number of text chunks and their sizes, we can ultimately control the level of detail in the output.
Motivation
I hope it's self evident!
