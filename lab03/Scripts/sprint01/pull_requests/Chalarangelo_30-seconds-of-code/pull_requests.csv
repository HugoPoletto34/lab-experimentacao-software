Resolves #244

remove pullAll and update pull to work with any amount of values or an array, so we have a more general-use-case function without cluttering the list.

pull
Mutates the original array to filter out the values specified.
Use Array.filter() and Array.includes() to pull out the values that are not needed.
Use Array.length = 0 to mutate the passed in array by resetting it's length to zero and Array.push() to re-populate it with only the pulled values.
(For a snippet that does not mutate the original array see without)
const pull = (arr, ...args) => {
  let pulled = arr.filter((v, i) => !args.toString().split(',').includes(v));
  arr.length = 0; pulled.forEach(v => arr.push(v));
};

// let myArray1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'b', 'c'];
// pull(myArray1, 'a', 'c');
// console.log(myArray1) -> [ 'b', 'b' ]

// let myArray2 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'b', 'c'];
// pull(myArray2, ['a', 'c']);
// console.log(myArray2) -> [ 'b', 'b' ]

Allows for autopluralization with currying
Allows any number. -1 and 1 are considered ""singular"". Actually should -1 be plural? I don't really know. It doesn't make sense to pluralize negatives, but I feel like it shouldn't throw an error at all. It also coerces strings etc to a number to make life easier.

Enough for the start. Two of the very basic snippets for working with binary trees. I've added emoji 🎄  and updated the tag docs. The tagger script capitalizes everything down but that could be changed before merging.
Also if someone has ideas on how to name the snippets, all ideas are welcome!
If someone has time, these are on the list too: BFS, DFS, contains. If not I will do them in the few days.

I've added basic CRUD calls. They are implemented using XMLHttpRequest web API.
In case someone missed the discussion on gitter earlier today this is the reason we are adding those snippets:

yeah it's the introductory way and it's easier to figure out, promises and fetch can be hard to grasp for newbies

I think I've done everything correctly. I would like someone to review changes and descriptions before we merge this. I had few problems with Git but everything should be fine.

Used idiomatic javascript to avoid complex array functions. The rest operator is used to collect all the remaining argument of the function. So instead of taking the whole list and then popping the first element (this is expensive), we simply retain the first argument as a variable first and the rest of the arguments are stored as array in rest variable. Then we just change the order of arguments.
I think this code is easy to grok and is much faster and more ES6.
const flip = fn => (first, ...rest) => fn(...rest, first);
Note -
Intentionally used the word rest instead of args because I felt for this case rest better helps people understand that , rest holds all the args after first arg. If I have used args then it partly implies that first is not an arg which is not true

Fix a problem due to the assumption that days are always 24 hours long, while due to DST one day a year is 23 hours and one day a year is 25 hours long. This lead this function to give the current date during one hour a year and the day after tomorrow for another hour a year.
Additionally, the function only worked correctly when the user was in the same timezone as UTC. For example in Amsterdam which 1 hour from DST it only worked 23 hours a day. And in Sydney which is 11 hours away from DST, the function only worked correctly for 13 hours each day. During the hours it didn't work correctly it would give the current date instead of tomorrows.

I have simplified the rearg snippet so that it's easier to understand in 30 seconds.
The simplified version is also more powerful - it now also support duplication of arguments & extension in the number of arguments.  I didn't add tests/examples for this new functionality (yet) since I wasn't sure if we would want to commit to these additional features in the future.
I have read the contributing guidelines, but it was not clear to me if I needed to open an issue before submitting this minor change.  I apologize in advance if I made this or some mistake in the process.

Changed longestItem function to run in O(n) rather than O(nlog(n)).
Note: The longest item returned will now be the last one in the array rather than an unspecified one (since Array.sort is not necessarily stable).

Simplified the implementation of nth Element to avoid unnecessary branching.
Updated documentation to reflect reality - the function would return undefined (not []) if the index was not in range.  This is maintained in the current implementation.

This is a fix to : #788
Changes are as follows:

Modified web.js to dynamically add side-nav to glossary and archive pages
Removed glossary-page-start.html, glossary-page-end.html
Renamed static-parts/archived-page-end.html -> static-parts/static-page-end.html and
static-parts/archived-page-start.html -> static-parts/static-page-start.html, because with few changes above templates can be reused for both glossary and archive pages.

Pages updated:

 /glossary
 /archived
 /about
 /contributing

For /about and /contributing, pages are just being copied from one location to other. Checking if I can dynamically generate them too.

Merged module.js and rollup.js into one script. Minor performance increase (8.3s -> 7.8s).
Updated module.js to cut down the number of I/O operations. Reasonable performance increase (7.8s -> 5.1s).
Updated module.js to output a full (snippets + archive) _30s.js file in test. Negligible performance impact.
Made module.js skip bundles when running on non-CRON/API builds. Performance for the test package seems to be ~52ms on my machine, which should be pretty good for running tests on commits.
Updated tdd.js to follow the structure discussed above, updated all .test.js files, fixed a few failing tests, cleaned up orphaned tests etc. Overall performance is about the same, maybe we managed to earn ourselves a second or two.

Added eslint to the devDependencies.
Configured .eslintrc.json to enforce our coding style.
Swapped out semistandard, as eslint does the same job that it did.
Updated lint.js to use eslint (some rules are overriden there in order to deal with all the problematic data that comes from generated files).
Made eslint --fix errors on its own in the linter process and give us a report (that does not seem to auto-commit from CI builds, that's probably for the best).
Run the new linter on pretty much everything, some rules are now better applied across the board.

Only thing remaining is to configure Codacy to use this ruleset from now on and we are golden.

I've added a handy utility snippet that checks whether a provided value is negative zero or not.
Before you make a noise, let me explain a bit how JavaScript handles numbers and why is this function useful to some people.
JavaScript 0 and -0 examples
0 === -0 //  true
0 / 3 // equals to 0
0 / -3 // equals to  -0

Infinity === -Infinity // false
Yes. I know that negative zero doesn't exist in real Math but this is just how JavaScript engine threats it. Whenever JavaScript engine works with dividing negatives, it treats them as positives and adds - afterward.
Usage
Not much as you've guessed it but this function can be used when writing complex animations, a -0 on just finished animation can provide information on whether the animation was coming from the right or the left side etc.
Note about tests
I wrote the tests, they don't pass due to the way they work. In order to make them work the _30s needs isNegativeZero module in it. (I've tested manually and they do work).

Most CSV parsers understand strings to be wrapped in double quotes, and double-quotes within strings to be escaped with additional double quotes. In addition, values not enclosed in quotes should be interpreted as numeric.
This modifies the existing one-liner to provide this functionality. The function should now produce a CSV that can be parsed by any compliant reader for just about any kind of input.

Modified createDirIfNotExists snippet. Now it is asynchronous and safe. Those reasons are attached in the snippet description:
Using fs.exists() to check for the existence of a directory before calling fs.mkdir() is not recommended. 
Doing so introduces a race condition, since other processes may change the directory's state between the two calls. 
Instead, user code should create the directory directly and handle the error raised if the directory does not exist.

Why not fs.mkdirSync? In busy processes, the programmer is strongly encouraged to use the asynchronous versions of these calls. 
The synchronous versions will block the entire process until they complete — halting all connections.

Also, updated module.js script. It didn't want to work with multiple require

The functions already expect an array. There is no need to spread the argument and re-spread to use apply. This creates an unnecessary one-element array for no benefit. We could expect an array argument without spreading and then pass it directly to apply. But since we all encourage modern JS, using the spread syntax is better.

The current configuration is not making eslint aware that we are using jest. It has only the test global implicitly setup in the globals section.
A better way to do this is to enable the jest environment option.
Jest provides a lot of useful globals that are ready to use. For example, the expect function, it is currently required by all the 372 test files. This is not necessary.
The jest environment option for eslint supports out of the box all the available globals (test, it, describe, etc)...
This PR also changes scripts/tdd.js to remove the requiring of the expect function when creating undefined test files

Some expectations involving asynchronous tests were not working. By default, Jest tests complete once they reach the end of their execution. If there are assertions on asynchronous code, but we don't make Jest aware of it, those tests will simply pass.
There are specific ways to make Jest wait for expectations:
For callback-based code, we can introduce the done argument on each test. This is a callback function provided by Jest. Each test will wait for this callback to be executed after the desired assertions are done. If the done callback is not invoked, the test will timeout.
For promise-based code, we can simply return the promise from the test and use run the expectations on the then. Or we can use the resolves / rejects helpers.
Finally, we can use also async / await, by making the test closure async, and using await get the values to do the expectations.
More details about this on the official docs.

hasKey snippet is really handy to check for inner keys in nested objects. Unfortunately current implementation of it fails for a particular case:
(Where one key is prefix of another and it has object value, in this case b & b.c)
let obj = {
  'a': 1,
  'b': { 'e': 4 },
  'b.c': 5
};

hasKey(obj, 'b.c');
// should return ""true"" but returns ""false""

The above scenario can not be handled with current method signature of accepting second argument as string. Using function signature where it accepts Array of keys, we can address above scenario along with other simpler cases.
This also simplifies overall implementation of function without using any recursion or string manipulations. With Array as key list, we can use Array.prototype.every() to simplify and early return on failure.


This PR updates hasKey snippet to handle this failing cases along with existing ones and simplifies overall implementation of the function.

This changes signature of hasKey snippet to accept list of strings instead of just a string, which can be called as a breaking change.

As explained in the issue, the acc + ((val * 2) % 9) || 9) logic in the function makes it so if even if the acc should equal zero it gets set to 9, which messes up the rest of the calculation. You can see this happening here:

As shared in issue#1175. The current code fails to restore nested properties and doesnot cater for scenairos like
unflattenObject({ 'a.b': 1, 'a.c': 2, d: 3 })
unflattenObject({ 'a.b': 'foo', d: 3 })
where either the same key is being refered more than once or the values are non numbers. More detials can be seen in this runkit shared in the issue as well.
An additional scenario which the code failed to handle was when the flat path reffered to particular indices in the arrays values against a key. For example.
unflattenObject({ 'a.b.0': 5, d: 3 })
should return something like {a:{b:[5]}, d: 3}. However, the code fails to compile.
Solution
I fixed the snippet to handle these scenarios along with some improvements. The updated code which passes all these tests can be seen in this runkit.
Modifications / Improvements
The previous code uses JSON.parse() to parse the manually built string into JSON and then merges it with the accumulator using Object.assign(). This happened for ever iteration of Array.prototype.reduce(). My code takes a slightly different approach of making the reference to the values as the next accumulator. This ways, I can directly mutate and nested objects without having to merge on each iteration. This arguably improves the performance fo the code.",2,2
