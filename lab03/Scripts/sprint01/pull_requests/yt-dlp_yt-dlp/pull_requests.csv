Description of your pull request and other information
Main part of this PR was pull requested two times by @tsukumijima (ytdl-org/youtube-dl#23824 / blackjack4494/youtube-dlc#55).

niconico (ニコニコ動画), which is not known outside Japan, is the largest video sharing site in Japan.
niconico has begun using HLS to encrypt the distribution of some official videos, such as anime, on March 5, 2019.
As a result, some official videos can no longer be downloaded with the previously used Extractor.
(Examples of videos that can be downloaded as before: https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm32868846
(Example of video that cannot be downloaded due to HLS encryption: https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/so36189921)
This pull request includes an improvement to allow you to download niconico's encrypted HLS videos.
In niconico, if you do not send ""heartbeat"" once every 60 seconds, the download session will be closed and you will get a 403 error.
This pull request also includes a change to allow ""heartbeat"" to be sent once every 60 seconds during the download, and to allow long videos to be downloaded to the end.
We have also made changes so that you can obtain higher quality thumbnails and original titles.
(Sentence may be a bit strange because we use translation)

Additonaly, I write some code for downloading movie from SMILEVIDEO, niconico douga old distribution system. Niconico douga changed its distribution system from SMILEVIDEO to DMC (Dwango Media Cluster) in 2016. But SMILEVIDEO was stored source movies until 2018-06-28, and we can access this movies even now.",4,13

I saw #34 and noticed nobody had done it yet;
So, I searched this repo for every appearence of ""dlc"" and determined whether it should be changed. In general, I followed these rules:
youtube-dlc (with a dash) becomes yt-dlp (also with a dash)
youtube_dlc (with an underscore) becomes yt_dlc (also with an underscore)
yt-dlc (with a dash) becomes yt-dlp (also with a dash)
ytdlc becomes ytdlp
I didn't change some instances, like youtube-dlc at https://github.com/pukkandan/yt-dlp/blob/7620cd46c3ac6c265be3730925281f77a801c89c/youtube_dlc/extractor/dropbox.py#L16

Description of your pull request and other information
This PR is a copy of ytdl-org/youtube-dl#27859 (as of Feb 2021: in status Open)
However, that PR contains the full commit history (pretty clean and readable), while this one here is simply the squashed version.
This is a new extractor for the video platform Nebula (https://watchnebula.com/), created by the streamer community Standard. Nebula uses the Zype video infrastructure and this extractor is using the url_transparent mode to hand off video extraction to the Zype extractor (which has shown to be super reliable here).
All videos on Nebula require a subscription to access. Multiple authentication methods are supported, with the most convenient probably being .netrc, but a few alternatives (cookie jar, environment variable, token in --videopassword) have been implemented as well.
As there are no known freely available videos, the three test cases only pass when an auth token to a user account with a (paid) subscription is present. This can be specified using the NEBULA_TOKEN environment variable (as I couldn't figure out a way to use --netrc in unit tests).
I have aimed to provide comprehensive documentation of approach and behavior in class and method docstrings.
Initial discussion has occured on issue ytdl-org/youtube-dl#21258. I didn't open the issue, but hijacked it for my implementation.
Afterwards, development discussion has occured over multiple months on PR ytdl-org/youtube-dl#24805. The fork that PR was based on has been destroyed by the DMCA takedown. That's why it had to be reopened as ytdl-org/youtube-dl#27859.",2,10

Very much WIP. This is a rewrite of the comments extraction. I have rewrote this in similar fashion to how the Tab Extractor _entries function works. This should also make switching API's easier if YouTube ever deprecates this one in the future.
Fixes:

#121

TODO:

check externalErrorMessage actually exists
investigate 413 errors in more depth
fix protected member accesses for extracting continuations
for the expected_video_comment_count removal of ""comments"" word, check if that is actually needed anymore

Improvements that can be added:

Better console output for reply pages
Limit amount of comments downloaded (can probably be done in _extract_comments)
Switch sorting modes (continuations for this are in header of continuation_renderer)
Disable/Enable replies
Last but not least:
Needs a lot of testing.",2,0

Description of your pull request and other information
Adds extractor for NFHS Network, a subscription site for high school sporting events. This site has terrible security and all data can be accessed through unauthenticated API endpoints. I purposely left some things commented because I have a couple questions.


Should url be hardcoded in each of the test's info_dict? Unlike most streaming sites today, NFHS Network uses static m3u8 urls with no parameters or variation of any kind.


I'm not sure how to sort the formats, because _sort_formats incorrectly chooses best when given one stream with a lower bitrate and declared codecs and another stream with higher bitrate and no declared codecs. This is why I (temporarily) removed it.




Not all HLS playlists served by NFHS Network are sorted, so some sorting must be implemented.
Example: the playlist served for this event https://www.nfhsnetwork.com/events/wiaa-wi/gam5cb37c4cfc: https://hls.bcast.nfhsnetwork.com/broadcast/bdcb2c62fccc9/vod.m3u8 is not sorted.
This is my first time contributing to yt-dlp, so I hope the code isn't too terrible.",2,5

The channel syncid (or ""delegated session id"") is also available in the ytcfg. This PR adds support to the syncid extraction function to be able to extract it from ytcfg.
In ytcfg:
DATASYNC_ID is the exact same format as datasyncId
DELEGATED_SESSION_ID appears to be the channel syncid itself that we extract only if we are on a secondary account.
Also to note - the comment extractor was already calling this function using ytcfg. Which means it was never extracting the syncid. (Though the comment api ajax endpoint may not require this syncid at this time)",2,0

After submitting this PR, I also added extraction from DASH and Smooth Streaming manifests and converted more extractors. The ComCarCoff extractor has been removed since the original PR was submitted upstream, but I tested the manifest parsers with most of the extractors that I also modified in this one. I have not tested this on any live streams; I doubt any of the downloaders work with those.
Not all extractors have been converted to pick up subtitle tracks from streaming manifests; instead, to facilitate incremental porting and maintain compatibility with upstream extractors, wrappers have been added that discard any subtitle tracks and only return audio and video streams. Those wrappers will report a warning if any subtitle tracks are detected that couldn’t be returned, to ease diagnosis and identification of potential porting targets. More potential sites can be found by searching through the upstream issue tracker: https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues?q=%22Unknown+MIME+type+application%2Fmp4+in+DASH+manifest%22

Remaining issues:

 HLS subtitle support

 Assembling on the fly, without keeping temporary files around
 AES support: untested, but should work as long as it works the same way as normal streams
 Correctness of timestamp adjustment against X-TIMESTAMP-MAP
 Cue deduplication (how many can be duplicated between segments, is deduplication even necessary)
 Handling of late header blocks: we leave a warning, might need to revisit this later
 Handling of direct links to subtitle streams: postponed to a future pull request


 DASH subtitle support

 Playability of assembled DASH subtitles: postponed


 Smooth Streaming subtitle support

 Playability and validity of assembled SSTR subtitles: postponed


 Migration of remaining extractors: we keep the compat wrappers, further extractors will be migrated incrementally; no more will be migrated in this pull request

From ytdl-org/youtube-dl#28778 which in turn is from ytdl-org/youtube-dl#26160
TL;DR, adds support for format 141 and any other YTM-only formats that come about.
@craftingmod let us know if you are happy with us merging this here.
Changes from original PR:

Use URL smuggling to handle YTM playlists more elegantly without breaking --playlist-end etc (credit @pukkandan).
Only use YTM data for additional formats (i.e. merge the formats with normal Youtube player res formats). This should fix any extraction issues due to differences between the YTM and YT player responses.

The purpose of this pull request is to fix an issue in the tenplay extractor, where the script would not correctly obtain an authentication token before attempting to download a video, resulting in a 403 error. I've solved this by requiring a username and password to generate the token, and then providing it when downloading the m3u8 playlist.
I've also made some minor adjustments to the metadata that is extracted, as the tenplay API has been updated and the json keys changed. (e.g 'picture' has been changed to imageUrl for show thumbnails).",2,1

Description of your pull request and other information
Hi! This is my first pull request, so forgive me if there are any formatting errors or such in the code.
As mentioned in youtube-dl PR #25717, both ffmpeg and AtomicParsley support embedding both JPEG and PNG files. Accordingly, if yt-dlp is given either a JPEG or PNG file, yt-dlp will pass the files along without issue to be embedded.
However, yt-dlp currently only supports converting thumbnails to JPG if they are in another, unsupported format. I believe this is behavior inherited from youtube-dl. This confused me a bit since although both JPG and PNG are allowed to be embedded, you can only convert to JPG. Since ffmpeg supports converting files to PNG (I've tested this on ffmpeg-win-2.2.2), I've opened this pull request to allow thumbnails to be converted to PNG using --convert-thumbnails png.
Since PNG is a lossless format in contrast to JPEG, which is lossy, I've also changed the default behavior to convert thumbnails in unsupported formats to PNG. PNG is supported in both .mp4 files (via ID3) and .mkv files.
Thank you for your time!",2,6

This implements a downloader for slideshow-like streams and uses it to download slides from Mediasite presentations and also thumbnail streams found in DASH manifests.
The hardest part was probably picking the format for the downloaded slides. I needed a format that is:

self-contained (in a single file)
easy to generate
can losslessly accommodate stand-alone images in disparate formats in a single file
can be readily opened by widely available software

Given these constraints, my only option was… MHTML. This is admittedly an unorthodox choice for a media format, and it should be noted that basically the only major software that supports it now are Blink-based browsers. Nevertheless, thanks to the HTML stub included in the file, the slideshow in the file can be readily viewed in those. I would have even included an interactive player, if it weren’t for the fact that Chromium doesn’t run scripts in MHTML files, so it would have been a considerable effort to implement something that wouldn’t even be usable; thus, I limited myself to including some basic CSS to make the slideshow passively viewable in a browser. Should the user want to extract the images, they will have no problem finding software libraries to process MIME multipart messages.

I decided to try implementing this extractor since I was bored. The code is kinda terrible since it parses socket.io messages itself without relying on a dedicated socket.io client library like this. I don't even speak Japanese and have basically no idea what this website is lol. Also, the broadcasts last for a very short time and that makes testing very difficult, and the broadcasts have very little metadata to extract. Let me know if I should remove the uploader field since as far as I can tell it's always the same as the title.

Description of your pull request and other information
Basic support for saved Youtube videos on the Wayback Machine (web.archive.org)
This uses the https://web.archive.org/web/2oe_/http://wayback-fakeurl.archive.org/yt/<video id> endpoint where the web archive provides the link to the video file, if it exists (or the backend is working).
I've also added some basic code that attempts to extract the format details and/or extension from the video url web archive provides. Though, this won't work in all cases (e.g. old flash videos don't have details in the url).
I have also had to go against convention here with having no title. I have hard-coded ""Unknown Video"" as the title to pass tests. The original PR had support for this by extracting the <title> element from the archived html page, but that brings mulitple issues (redirect page, saved videos without html page, etc.)
I have (re)implemented basic title extraction, with some checks to help ensure it is reliable. However, there are still cases where the title will fail to be extracted (redirect page, not archived, or YouTube having a weird phase of rewriting title tags). So in those cases we default to the video id for the title.
TODO:

 check the regex (I'm pretty new at regex!)
  investigate returning and improving title extraction

Description of your pull request and other information
This is a complete replacement of SponSkrub. New features:

Proper cut implemented using concat FFmpeg demuxer, mentioned in faissaloo/SponSkrub#32. According to https://sattlers.org/2019/09/30/ffmpeg-split-and-cut-video-segments/, small stutter/frame skipping mentioned in the issue can be fixed by forcing key frames, an option for which is also provided.
Implementation takes videoDuration from SponsorBlock responses into account.
Implementation is compatible with --skip-chapters.
Different chapter merge algorithm, which does not lead to ""Chapter end time X before chapter start Y"" reported in faissaloo/SponSkrub#27.
SRT, ASS, and VTT subtitles (seems like FFmpeg does not fully support others) are cut along with the video, solving faissaloo/SponSkrub#21.
Fully cross-platform (SponSkrub still doesn't have macOS binaries).
Requires no external dependencies.
Written in Python, not in D, which makes contributing much easier.",6,48

Live chat extraction used to be supported for replays only. This pull request adds support for real time live chat, too. To avoid breaking any existing projects depending on the format of the replay chat files, this pull request adds a container resembing the replay format, parsing unknown information from the available context. A flag isLive is also added so that consumers can do special processing for non-replay live chat files if needed.

Description of your pull request and other information
The ""--ignore-no-formats-error"" parameter does not work as expected when extracting video info using the ""--simulate"" or ""--skip-download"" options, with yt-dlp bailing out on undownloadable videos without printing any information. This issue makes extracting information from scheduled livestreams/premieres or membership videos impossible, as no information is returned. This PR allows such information to be extracted and the videos filterable similar to uploads and archived livestreams. Specifically, we continue processing when no formats are found so that json output and other possbile extractions work.
We also add ""is_upcoming"", ""live_starttime"", and ""live_endtime"" to the info dict, as they are useful for livestreams and premieres (especially is_upcoming) and no other equivalent exists.",4,5

The information of all languages is always extracted. Maybe there should be an some way for the user to pre-select the language?

Description of your pull request and other information
Recently, it became possible to download Youtube live chat live without having to wait until after a stream has ended. With a different patch, it became possible to download metadata about ""upcoming"" streams using the --ignore-no-formats-error option. Since live chat is often available before a livestream (or premiere), it is useful to be able to download live chat from the moment the URL comes up.
The support for downloading live chat this early is already there, however an oversight caused the ""replay"" API endpoint to be chosen by mistake, causing the download to fail. This patch merely uses the metadata provided by Youtube to choose the right endpoint. It works even if a stream is late or rescheduled.
Note that when you try to test the unpatched version, the downloader keeps behind a fragment file with HTML (not JSON) in it, which interferes with the downloader for reasons I do not know.",3,0

Description of your pull request and other information
Mostly just a draft at the moment. Likely will not merge until YouTube completely moves over to the new API for comment extraction on web client.
Fixes #438
ISSUES:


YouTube hasn't fully switched over to the new API yet, and still provides the old token. Currently I handle this by manually generating a new API initial token. I also added  handling for the old API JSON structure (as that will still be used if visitorData was linked to the old comment section).


YouTube sometimes ends up providing continuation tokens but no comment data. Mostly happens in popular sorting mode, but I have observed this happening for the odd reply thread. Currently I just break if it detects no continuation data, and stopping if that happens for the parent pages.


This will need some good testing to check any edge cases I may have missed.

 Rewrite to support new response structure
 Add support for old response structure
 Convert old initial token to new token

Description of your pull request and other information
Disabled login by api since it needs a rework. Instead added the option to use one of these ['token', 'auth', 'oauth', 'bearer', 'authorization'] as a username to let the extractor know the password will be an oauth/access token. You still can add --add-header ""Authorization: OAuth <access_token>"" as usual. However this patch allows you to use netrc to save your token.
I will try to see how long a token is valid exactly (from experience I used the same token once for at least a week). There is also _soundcloud_session which can be used to retrieve the token you got when you signed in. I assume it got a shorter time span but never glimpsed on it so I will try the one I've saved in a week or so.
This workaround patch is rather for convenience
For simplicity use e.g. chrome devtools -> Application -> Storage -> Cookies
click on soundcloud.com and filter for oauth

Download and parse ThePlatform metadata to get more metadata about the content including runtime, series name, season number, and episode number.
The only quirk is that I found that the series name is sometimes nested into a single element array so I added a handler for that.
I updated the existing test to also test these extra attributes.",2,0

This is a port of my pull request for youtube_dl: ytdl-org/youtube-dl#29201
It adds --cookies-from-browser <browser_name> and --cookies-from-browser <browser_name>:<profile_path> options. This is much easier to use than the --cookies option and is also safer because there is no opportunity to mishandle a cookies file.

Since the original pull request was aimed at youtube_dl it supports python2 and where possible uses youtube_dl's own cryptographic implementations to avoid a strict dependency on pycryptodome. Since ytdlp does not support such old python versions I could remove some of the compatability layers if you prefer?",2,7

Related to #486.
This fixes broken RTP extraction, due to obfuscation the website apparently started employing a while ago. Apart from employing URL-encoded base64, the website code contains a handful of false pieces of data that more naïve regex search might capture instead of the real data; I suspect this may be specifically to throw off scrapers like this one. Coming up with a regex that captures the real data instead of the booby traps was somewhat tricky. I worry we may need to start preparing for an obfuscation arms race, and eventually add a full JavaScript parser and evaluator.",3,4

Description of your pull request and other information

Adds availability key support for playlists.
Adds fallback for is_unlisted in YouTubeIE (related: #501) (Note: without microformat we won't be able to detect if a video is public since unlisted will be None)

Currently only supports public, unlisted and private availability forms for playlists. I'm not aware of any other examples of the other types.
Note: as of writing, the public availability is only possible when the playlist is a personal public playlist and auth is given.
TODO:

 Can probably add a test of some sort",2,4

Currently, age-restricted + non-embeddable videos do not work when trying to download them from the EU, because the clientScreen: EMBED bypass cannot be used for non-embeddable videos. Even with Cookies, users from the EU receive the AGE_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED status. Today I searched for more clientName's. I found the clientName 62, which is used by YouTube Studio (Web). This client requires a user session, but no age verification. Furthermore, non-embeddable videos work.

Hey @nihil-admirari
#360 is way too big and the implementation of its features are way too coupled that I was having a hard time reviewing/refactoring it. So I am thinking of splitting it up into smaller chunks which can be merged independently.
There are 3 main parts to that PR:

SponsorBlockPP - Fetch data from the API and writes the data to the infodict. It should be a preprocessor (similar to MetadataParser) so that the data this retrieves will be available in the infojson
RemoveChaptersPP - Removes the requested chapters from the file
Chapter Merger - This takes the sponsorblock data as well as the normal chapters data and merges them together into a single list which can either be added to the metadata or be removed from the file. Having this be a seperate class/module would allow us to first remove the requested chapters and then merge the data without introducing too much coupling between RemoveChapters, SponsorBlock and AddMetadata. These PPs will still need to be aware of SponsorBlockPP's existence, but will not care about its implementation details

This PR adds only (2) RemoveChaptersPP",2,6

Found an easy fix for VH1 and after realizing that TVLand pulled from paramountnetworkie which still isn't fixed ran it through the MTVExtractor and it worked. So figured it could just use the MTVExtractor instead. Oh and since the code pulled from the NickExtractor was used within the MTV extractor didn't see a need for it to be inside of the NickExtractor anymore.
I still haven't figured out the deal with paramountnetwork.com yet, but I'm still trying.

deprecate identity_token: doesn't appear to be used by YouTube anymore (at least in most main calls). I've removed it from function parameters but kept it being extracted from ytcfg in the generate api headers func for now.

Description of your pull request and other information
I have been experiencing a very rare, intermittent bug using the FFmpegMetadata postprocessor, where the file, after adding metadata, would always be deleted without explanation under certain circumstances. This only seems to occur when the location of the writes are on a network mounted filesystem using Windows ACLs for file permissions.
I believe I've narrowed the cause to the following two occasionally occurring pairs of operations:
os.remove(encodeFilename(filename))
os.rename(encodeFilename(temp_filename), encodeFilename(filename))
os.rename is only guaranteed to replace a file on Unix systems, which is why it is preceded by os.remove. However, the remove call is not guaranteed to be atomic, and thus may (and in my case, always was) executed arbitrarily compared to the immediately following rename call.
The solution is to always use os.replace for these two operations. This is completely platform agnostic, and guaranteed atomic as well.
This function was only introduced in python 3.3, but I would assume this is acceptable since support for previous version is theoretically dropped
While I am a software developer by trade, I have not previously contributed to this project and I am not intimately familiar with all the details of this codebase or python3 standards, so please let me know if this PR is invalid and the issue should be solved some other way or if there's some improvements that can be made to these changes.",2,0

Some subreddits are quarantined which prevents yt-dlp from fetching the JSON metadata. This PR adds a cookie that fixes this. There isn't any check for if the subreddit is quarantined before adding the cookie but having it present anyways doesn't appear to cause any issues in my testing.

Description of your pull request and other information
Not sure what to call this.
This code was originally from  #682.
This PR adds:

fallback player url extraction when it fails to be extracted from the webpage
don't download js player unnecessarily for clients that don't require it
try extract js player url from any additional client configs
ability to skip the js player usage/download (inc iframe fallback).

This overrides the clients' config setting.
This can be enabled with --extractor-args youtube:player_skip=js
Formats that require signature decryption will be skipped automatically (since no player url)


ability to skip the webpage download

This can be enabled with --extractor-args youtube:player_skip=webpage



KNOWN ISSUES:

authentication for multi-channel accounts and multi-account cookies may not work correctly if the webpage (and any additional client configs) are not downloaded.

Adds extractor for mediaklikk.hu, hirado.hu, petofilive.hu and m4sport.hu
This PR is derived from ytdl-org/youtube-dl#25098 by @mrx23dot, which in turn is derived from ytdl-org/youtube-dl#17453 by @tmarki
Upstream request: resolves ytdl-org/youtube-dl#21431

MédiaKlikk is the free VOD video platform of MTVA.
MTVA (Media Services and Support Trust Fund) is Hungary's state-owned national public-service broadcasting organization, and it's the successor of MTV (state television service) and MR (state radio service).

Also related: ytdl-org/youtube-dl#22190, ytdl-org/youtube-dl#28054
I've made a fair few changes from the original PR.
I notice DASH streams are skipped in extraction, however they do exist. But in testing they sometimes work, but sometimes don't.. So I'm keeping it as is for now.
Note: geo-restricted to Hungary for the most part",4,4

This attempts to record YouTube live from the start. This does not provide general DASH live downloader, but some part of the code could be reused.
TODO

 #1036, merge using ffmpeg after that
 Work better for streams which does not have very early segments, found in some long-lasting live you can find by searching ""jazz live""
 do re-extraction every 5 hours, to prevent from being stopped when one manifest reached its time limit
 Fix KeyboardInterrupt on Windows (works on Linux, by @nao20010128nao)

Long-lasting live: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEvM-OUbaKs
Shorter live: find one here: https://nijisanji.net/ https://schedule.hololive.tv/
Does it work on M3U8 formats? Why do you enable include_live_dash?
YouTube doesn't provide older segments for m3u8 formats. Confirmed on my end, and ytarchive didn't that too.
The README says ""These formats don't download properly"" for include_live_dash, but enabling it along with download_live_from_start do download properly.
USAGE
After downloading this PR, add --live-from-start to options to enable the feature.
e.g:
./yt-dlp.sh fEvM-OUbaKs --live-from-start
... and add any options you want
You always need this even after this PR is merged.

From my testing there are at least two page formats for videos:

video embedded in article
dedicated video page

Viewers can chat & send gifts (using real money) to the broadcaster. Users primarily use the applications to watch the stream, but the website is also available.
The extractor uses an internal API which returns JSON. It checks if the user is currently live and provides an appropriate error message if they aren't.

Do not use mutable default arguments in Python, unless you have a REALLY good reason to do so.
Why? Because it can lead to all sorts of nasty and horrible bugs, give you headaches and waste everyone's time.
Instead, default to None and assign the mutable value inside the function.

I can't bother to copy-paste the whole thing, so above is the tl;dr; part.
If you wish to discuss this further, there's an issue #1021 for it. Please keep this strictly about the change.

With this patch, executing a second yt-dlp instance still results in a message: ""[download] Resuming download at byte 2159224"", however now the the next message is: ""ERROR: unable to open for writing: [Errno 11] Resource temporarily unavailable"". This fixes the current condition where the two processes would write to the same file, corrupting it. Now the second yt-dlp process moves on to the next required file, so in the case ""Downloading 1 format(s): 303+251"" if "".f303.webm"" is advisory locked by process 1, process 2 will move on to "".f251.webm"".
If a .part file is being used (--no-part is not enabled), there is a race condition if the .part file is closed by one process before it is renamed to remove '.part'. In that time window, the other process could modify the .part file before it's renamed. Using --no-part prevents this. It should be possible to lock the .part files.
There is no race condition where process 2 finishes downloading the last needed file (the audio, "".f251.webm"" in this example) after skipping the advisory locked video file ("".f303.webm"") that process 1 is writing to, because process 2 does not attempt to merge the two files together, instead, when process 1 completes it sees the already downloaded audio (*.f251.webm) and merges the two complete files together (usually) into a webm (because it [process 1] encountered no errors).
In the less common 'opposite' case, where process 1 (downloading the video 303) completes while process 2 is still writing the audio 251 file (and therefore has it advisory locked), the 303 process (process 1) throws the message ""[download] Resuming download at byte 523264"" and then exits with ""ERROR: unable to open for writing: [Errno 11] Resource temporarily unavailable"" because it is obeying the advisory lock process 2 has on ""*.f251.webm"". Unfortunately when the 251/audio process (process 2) completes, it does not attempt to merge the now complete video and audio files, since it has no way to know if the 303 file is complete (and it [process 2] already encountered an error trying to write to the 303 video file). To correct this, process 2 could check if another process still holds an advisory lock on the 303 file, and if not, obtain a lock on it and then compare the 303 file stat() with the expected metadata. This corner case is still left to fix. Re-executing a third yt-dlp process to the same target with the completed audio and video files (still) results in the expected merge of the two.
Untested on Windows, locking is not implemented, should be a unchanged if the included function signature modification is correct.
On other platforms there should be no case that results in a corrupt output file.

Bug fix



Adapted from ytdl-org/youtube-dl#29996 by @sarnoud. Many of the changes in the upstream PR were unnecessary due to being already incorporated (like ripping subtitle tracks from manifests), making the diff footprint somewhat smaller. Testcases have not been updated.
Should resolve:

#970
ytdl-org/youtube-dl#29956
ytdl-org/youtube-dl#29957
ytdl-org/youtube-dl#29969
ytdl-org/youtube-dl#29990
ytdl-org/youtube-dl#30010

Very superficially tested to work well on the testcases listed in the extractor file. However, I am not able to test this on URLs for which the recent breakages were reported: the manifest URLs return 403 errors. I suspect this is because of geoblocking and not an error on the extractor’s part, but it still means I cannot vet for the correctness of certain features, like the detection of audio-description streams.
Issues resolved here:

 updating the endpoint
 extracting subtitles
 extraction from the extra DRM-free endpoint
 proper sorting of AD streams (untested)
 storyboard extraction (esp. duration of each spritesheet)",6,16

Description of your pull request and other information
This supersedes #682. (I'm making a new PR to keep things on topic - the other PR is a bit messy due to be experimental).

This PR adds support for falling back to the Innertube API when the webpage fails to download for whatever reason (429, network error, initial data extraction failure, etc.)
It is also possible to manually skip the webpage download by using --extractor-args youtubetab:skip=webpage
Also added a quick fix for the resolve MP to OLAK playlist handling, since that was broken.
At least at the time of writing, yt-dlp should now have a complete* workaround for the common** YouTube HTTP 429 error reported, for both video and tab extraction.
 *except private content accessible only through a secondary or greater account/channel
**common referring to the webpage request getting 429nd only, but the API still works.
resolves #926, resolves ytdl-org/youtube-dl#23638 (and most of the other 429 reports upstream)
Known issues:


When using cookies, the webpage is required to extract the required variables. Without this, the API requests will be for the first channel of the first account.


In the case of the user passing cookies, and the webpage failing to download, the tab extractor will raise an error. This is to stop unwanted behavior in variety of situations (e.g. an automated script to download a secondary channel liked playlist, but the webpage fails and starts downloading the first channel liked playlist).


Currently, the user can skip this check by passing --extractor-args youtubetab:skip=authcheck




channel search does not work (returns 0 results)

I think this is a YouTube a bug. YouTube appears to produce params for itself that it cannot understand.
See #1122 (comment)

This pull request adds %(hostname)s as an available field in the output template. I'm not sure precisely what the difference between url, webpage_url and original_url are but hopefully either %(hostname)s is either populated with a relevant url or not at all if for some reason none of the other fields are populated.
I think hostname is a good field for the template because it's useful to record the site in the filename but %(url)s can be long. Another idea might be to get the name of the extractor in order to obtain the site name (eg youtube rather than www.youtube.com which is longer) but I'm not sure if that would be easy to do. It's also not trivial to remove the TLD from the hostname since some like .co.uk have multiple levels. There is a library for this but it's not worth pulling in a dependency just for this.",3,2

Updating extractors in tvplay.py
Resolves #1333.
In summary I have update the tvplayhome extractor so that it works with their URL changes.
I have removed the following from the tvplay extractor and verified the following:
Old url -> New url

http://www.tvplay.lv -> https://tv3play.skaties.lv/
http://www.tv3play.se -> https://www.viafree.se/
http://www.tv6play.se -> https://www.viafree.se/
http://www.tv8play.se -> https://www.viafree.se/
http://www.tv10play.se -> https://www.viafree.se/
http://www.tv3play.no -> https://www.viafree.no/
http://www.viasat4play.no -> https://www.viafree.no/
http://www.tv6play.no -> dead
http://www.tv3play.dk -> https://www.viafree.dk/

So all the Baltics (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) now go to the tvplayhome extractor. All the Scandinavian (Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark) to the Viafree extractor.
The last remaining service in the tvplay extractor requires authentication it seems. So I did not bother checking if that is deprecated as well.",5,7

Description of your pull request and other information
This pull request adds 2 new capabilities to the TwitchVOD extractor:

extracting chapters
extracting live_chat

Chapters means game change events. The importance is that if the streamer changed to an other game, then the new game's name is seen as a new chapter from that timecode.
Live chat is the historical stream chat, it is saved as a subtitle with the language live_chat.
I also added a new test case that verifies the 2 new capabilities (at once, if that's a problem let me know), and also changed where the live chat JSON url is placed (it was already saved), but not sure if it's worth keeping because it'll be inaccessible in a few weeks.

Description of your pull request and other information
This pull request fixes the extractor for iPrima. With the exception of cnn.iprima.cz and autosalon.iprima.cz, all subdomains now use a new scheme that requires users to log in.
The support for autosalon.iprima.cz is dropped as it currently uses neither the old nor the new scheme. cnn.iprima.cz is still supported by the old extractor, which is kept with only minor fixes. It is also renamed to IPrimaCNNIE and only used for the aforementioned subdomain.
The new extractor addresses the need for login. Though it is possible to use cookies instead of manually logging the user in, this is not implemented. The extractor also detects geolocked content.",3,7

This is a new extractor I developed quite some time ago for televizeseznam.cz and submitted to ytdl-org/youtube-dl#21774. I have recently found yt-dlp and let's hope I'll be luckier here :) I rebased the original branch on top of a recent master branch, and did few modifications:

update _VALID_URL to support stream.cz as well,
remove old broken StreamCZ extractor in favor of this one,
add one more test with url pointing to stream.cz.

Description of your pull request and other information
Basically, the problem is that Reddit does not provide all formats when requesting with the base DASH and HLS playlist urls (e.g., https://v.redd.it/33hgok7dfbz71/DASHPlaylist.mpd). To fix this, certain query parameters must be attached to it, which must be obtained from the video page itself. Although this requires an additional request, it is well-justified as now one can download 1080p videos (i.e., highest quality)
I am quite surprised this wasn't fixed earlier, seeing that Reddit is quite a popular platform.

The primary purpose of this pull request is to add channel/playlist support to the Nebula extractor:
$ yt-dlp --netrc ""https://nebula.app/lindsayellis""
[nebula:collection] Logging in to Nebula with supplied credentials
[nebula:collection] Authorizing to Nebula
[nebula:collection] Retrieving Zype access token
[nebula:collection] lindsayellis: Retrieving channel page 1
[...]
[nebula:collection] lindsayellis: Retrieving channel page 11
[download] Downloading playlist: Lindsay Ellis
[nebula:collection] playlist Lindsay Ellis: Collected 104 videos; downloading 104 of them
[download] Downloading video 1 of 104
[Zype] 617408d3a9f9bc0001f47b3e: Downloading JSON metadata
[...]

However, one thing led to another and this ultimately ended up being a complete rewrite. I think the new extractor is much simpler, cleaner, and easier to read and reason about. The video and channel extractor classes inherit from a common base and I finally learned about the existance of _real_initialize() and therefore I'm using it now. 😉
The rewrite does not use the Zype API anymore, and therefore should also fix the Nebula extractor currently released, which is completely broken (#1690), raising a RegexNotFoundError: Unable to extract API key on every video.",3,12

a couple of the regexps used in metadata extraction are from old youtube-dl commits

Description of your pull request and other information
IMPROVEMENTS

Improved metadata extraction

currently best for polymer UI YouTube captures
Title extraction should be fairly stable across almost all YouTube versions
Extract filesize and extension from non-standard archive.org headers

unknown_video extension should no longer occur




Get archived thumbnails using CDX API
Smarter webpage capture downloading

query CDX for only 200 OK response captures
Tries multiple captures until it gets an infodict with title
order: try oldest polymer UI capture, user provided capture date, oldest capture from CDX, oldest capture web archive redirects to, newest capture web archive redirects to


New extractor arg: check_all=captures,thumbnails

thumbnails queries CDX API many more times to thumbnails archived under other youtube image servers.
captures adds all other captures dates returned by CDX API to the capture-try list


supports --ignore-no-formats-error to allow metadata extraction even if video is not archived

ISSUES

For querying captures of a video watch page, CDX API does not provide captures with extra params in the URL

e.g. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkhihxRKcrs&gl=US&hl=en
probably not much of a problem, still have the fallbacks or date in url given


yt-dlp has no idea how to sort the thumbnails

we really only have filesize to work with


De-duplicating thumbnails does not work if they were archived from different ytimg servers.
filesize not shown when downloading

archive.org doesn't provide content-length header for the video files



TODO

 Fix description extraction for some older versions of YouTube, if possible
 Fix up error handling to ensure everything is non-fatal
 Find and add more tests for edge cases
 Move video file URL request to be first, so we don't have to check for metadata if not needed?",2,0

There is another RedGifs extractor here #1631, but that's pages, rather than searches. But there will be merge conflicts with this due to filename. I'm happy to either rename file, or wait until that one is merged and resolve conflicts!

I'm adding a playlist extract for RedGifs searches.
There's another PR Ive noted above, #1631 which does redgifs pages. I'm happy to resolve merge conflicts if that goes in first, and neaten things up. Or to move this to a different file to avoid conflicts. I'm open to your suggestion there.
I wasn't sure whether to implement paging in this also?

Crackle has a metadata value called UseDRM. Currently yt-dlp interprets that as meaning all formats are DRM protected. It seems to really mean that there is at least one DRM protected format, but there may also be non-DRM formats. Letting the lower level extraction routines process all of the manifests will find the non-DRM formats and include or exclude the DRMed ones based on the 'allow_unplayable_formats' setting.

Description of your pull request and other information
This patch adds support for Glomex videos, both embeddable and on the (demo) site video.glomex.com. Glomex operates a media exchange platform, which powers their video marketplace service, based on revenue sharing. This is used quite a lot in large parts of Europe, primarily by digital news outlets, which embed in their assets video clips provided by various content providers (for example TV channels), tied with advertising.

Add new IEs

GlomexBaseIE: Base IE class
GlomexIE: Extract videos from video.glomex.com (by deferring to glomex:embed)

The integrationId parameter is apparently common across video.glomex.com, but we have to hard-code it as it is very hard to extract otherwise: it is deeply hidden in a script asset (a webpack component, which is typically regularly updated)


GlomexEmbedIE: Extract Glomex videos by matching the player URL


Query the API to extract metadata, detect video formats and get the respective (JWT protected) stream/source URLs
The API query may return one or more videos: the latter case is treated as a playlist

As this is otherwise identically handled, a separate IE was not deemed necessary
However title and description fields are not set for playlist results

They do not exist in the parent object; obtaining them from the first entry is not indicative for the playlist content
As the playlist order is not always stable (this is true at least for related videos playlists), it makes writing test cases impossible




Let GenericIE detect embeds by matching all three integration methods:

HTML: glomex-player tag or data attributes
Javascript: naive parsing of inline scripts for string constants assigned to integration parameters
Iframe: src attribute GlomexEmbedIE._VALID_URL


Let GlomexIE and the former embed detection pass the origin URL to GlomexEmbedIE by smuggling it in the player URL, as this is an expected parameter in API requests
Add test cases for both single videos and two playlist flavors

This patch adds support for video extraction from megatv.com, a popular Greek content provider and (recently re-)established TV network.

Add new IEs

MegaTVComBaseIE: Base IE class
MegaTVComIE: Extract from TV VOD pages and news articles, i.e. all sorts of pages showing videos on megatv.com
MegaTVComEmbedIE: Extract iframe-embeddable megatv.com videos


When video_id is not matched in the URL, namely for news articles, extract it (article_id) from a particular element on the web page
Derive metadata and sources directly from the web page, from data attributes of the player placeholder element and other commonly used elements
Let MegaTVComEmbedIE defer to MegaTVComIE for extraction, as the metadata on the embeddable page are some times slightly different, for the same video

JSON-LD extraction improvements

Support top-level @graph expressing implicit default graph

Wrap the control flow block in a function, which is called recursively upon such a structure
Per W3C JSON-LD v1.1 §4.9 (non-normative ref):




When a JSON-LD document's top-level structure is a map that contains no other keys than @graph and optionally @context (properties that are not mapped to an IRI or a keyword are ignored), @graph is  considered to express the otherwise implicit default graph.


Extend TestInfoExtractor.test_search_json_ld_realworld to cover said syntax (structure)

Refactor tests in a list of 3-tuples: test html string, expected dict, keyword args for InfoExtractor._search_json_ld

Description of your pull request and other information
""Callin"" is a site which hosts, essentially, podcasts. It is not handled by the generic extractor.
This PR implements episodes, but not shows, users, or ""highlights"".
I have assigned the internal episode UUID used by the site as id and episode_id and the URL slug as display_id. However, for uploader_id I have not used the internal user UUID, but rather the nickname (as found in user URLs). Although this is slightly inconsistent, the handle is useful information which nevertheless should not go in uploader or uploader_url (since there are more appropriate choices for both fields). Please let me know if you disagree with this arrangement.
The code works with everything I've tried so far, but Callin is new and has a limited number of items to test on. There are two possible technical issues that concern me:

The site doesn't explicitly number episodes. I have implemented a way of getting episode numbers by checking against the episode list in the show metadata, but I wouldn't be at all surprised if it ended up broken by some underlying pagination or truncation.
The site doesn't label underlying audio formats. I have assumed that all the M3Us are MP3, but is there a better way of doing this?

Thank you!",2,2

Description of your pull request and other information
This pull requests adds a new internal operator to output templates: &. This causes the value of the field to be replaced by a given static string.
The purpose of this is to build output templates that are highly flexible, e.g. for handling non-playlist and playlist videos with the same configuration. Suppose you want to prefix the playlist index of a video in front of the filename. Using the following template works fine: %(playlist_index)s - %(title)s.%(ext)s
But it has a flaw: if downloading non-playlist video (i.e. playlist_index is None), the filename is prefixed by NA - ; we don't want that. A first improvement would be to use an empty default string like so:
%(playlist_index|)s - %(title)s.%(ext)s
This at least removes the NA, but still leaves the useless -.
With this pull request, it is possible to create the following template, which removes both the NA and - if playlist_index is None (or more precisely, only adds the - if playlist_index is not None):
%(playlist_index|)s%(playlist_index& - )s%(title)s.%(ext)s
An alternative I have considered is to add an append operator, which appends a given string to the value if the field is not None:
%(playlist_index& - |)s%(title)s.%(ext)s
This makes the output template more readable, but is also less flexible (e.g. prefixes are not possible). By using the ""replacement"" interpretation we have the highest flexibility in creating custom output templates.
The resulting output template quickly become complex, but they are clearly a power-user feature. The idea is to write an output template once, that covers all use-cases and save it in the config file. This removes the necessity to switch config files (or pass -o parameter by other means) when downloading playlists vs. non-playlist videos.",2,5

I don't know how many other sites also use JSON-LD for chapter information, but adding extraction for it will probably benefit some other sites too.
I haven't yet checked if this causes any extractors to fail, but I wouldn't expect them to.
(Should probably add some tests, though.)",2,0

It seems that the keyring behaviour of Chromium based browsers on Linux desktop environments which use the Gnome keyring is different to what I originally expected. Using keyring.get_password(service_name, username) does not seem to work and Chromium itself appears to be listing all keys in order to obtain the one it needs (jaraco/keyring#556)
This pull request adds a fallback for the (assumed) Gnome keyring case. I have tested it on the Cinnamon desktop environment. The issue was first encountered here #1073 (comment)
because Chromium has a --password-store=<basic|gnome|kwallet> flag, it might be a good idea to specify which wallet to use (either with a command line option or environment variable?) but that is outside the scope of this pull request.",2,14

Resolves #1074
Related: ytdl-org/youtube-dl#30161, ytdl-org/youtube-dl#30150
We could also extract the video count, though I don't think there is a field for that and not sure what issues that may create (if any).
For the last modified date - it appears to be relative up until a certain point (I think a week) then it switches to a specific date (e.g. ""Last updated on 15 Sept 2021""). So accuracy when parsing this may not be as much of an issue as we initially thought.

Description of your pull request and other information
This patch improves the usability of get_elements_by_attribute and all its' calling variants for parsing nested HTML elements and allowing it to also return the matched element rather than only its' content.

Introduce get_first_element_by_tag, which matches the first element with the given tag and returns a tuple with the whole element and its' content

This works with HTMLBreakOnClosingTagParser, which parses nested elements to a stack of tags and stops when it reaches the closing
tag for the first opening tag it encountered


Modify get_elements_by_attribute to only match the opening tag and defer to the former function for finding the closing tag, so as to properly parse nested elements for the same tag; this is otherwise impossible with python (stdlib) RE
Also introduce kwarg return_content, which allows this function and all its' calling functions to either return the tag content (by default) or the matched element and its' content",2,6

(Spritual follow-up to #372.)
Most of these commits remove dead code and compatibility hacks meant for no longer supported Python versions. The SWF interpreter is removed again; it was pretty silly to keep it around in the first place.
The patches are pretty much unrelated to each other, so feel free to cherry-pick them individually as they are pushed on this branch.
Some further cleanups to consider:


_windows_write_string in utils seems to be a workaround for https://bugs.python.org/issue1602, which is apparently fixed in 3.6.  We should be able to get rid of it too. (I’m not sure what write_string itself adds over plain sys.stderr.write either.)


locked_file may be re-written as a @contextlib.contextmanager


uppercase_escape and lowercase_escape: those functions seem as bad an idea as addslashes and stripslashes in PHP. The former doesn’t appear to be used anywhere at all other than in tests; the latter has a number of appearances in extractors, most of which seem pretty redundant, e.g.

where the JSON parser is supposed to take case of \uXXXX escapes already.


Split utils into thematically-linked modules. Right now it contains functions for as disparate subtitle conversion, HTML parsing, dictionary traversal, bug workarounds, command line handling… It’s become an unmanageable mess.


Likewise, move out ‘common’ extractor methods from InfoExtractor, which has also become something of a god object anti-pattern. (Say, move manifest parsing into its own modules, one per manifest format.)",4,25

Description of your pull request and other information
I'm still getting some file access errors on my laptop, so I extended the logic to cover a few more places. I added try_remove, matching try_rename to avoid bare os.remove calls. To avoid code duplication I turned the retry logic into a decorator that wraps sanitize_open, try_remove and try_rename.
Notes:

try_rename had a custom error message. I couldn't add it to the decorator and I think it would have conflicted with the error handling so it now raises the built in error if it fails.
I added error.EINVAL (error 22) to the list of errors to retry, as I also saw this error on my laptop (I'm pretty sure it's the same problem as the parameter looks fine and it doesn't fail every time).",3,4

Addition of a test to check that ESPN+ videos raise the appropriate error. I tested this on my own but I am not sure how to codify this as a test within yt-dlp.
Additional metadata to return (e.g. description, dates, etc.). Accessing such information requires calls to a different API pointer which I didn't bother to code in.
It would be useful if one of the more veteran yt-dlp devs could check that I am following appropriate style/abstraction guidelines.

There is no specific issue raised for this (except for possibly this one on youtube-dl) but I feel adding this extractor would be immensely useful considering that:

ESPN is a very popular platform with replays available of many major sporting events and other TV shows, for those with access to ESPN through their cable TV provider.
Before about August, such videos could only be downloaded by opening up the video and snooping for the playlist m3u8.
Since August, ESPN has updated their platform so that only dash DRM videos play. Downloading an unprotected video required making modifications to the snooped URL, which had to be done quickly as the authorization expires quickly. Now, with this extractor, unprotected HLS streams are returned by default, saving many steps for anyone wishing to download these videos.",4,16

Description of your pull request and other information
This PR fixes the Zattoo information extractor (as described in #1244). The most important change is the ability to log in again. Furthermore, it successfully extracts videos from the 7-day-replay, ondemand and recording section.
You need a Zattoo premium account to test it. Unfortunately I cannot provide one. If anyone can provide an account to a maintainer to test this PR, let me know. To the maintainers: It should also be possible to create a new account on zattoo.com (with a Swiss IP) and you can get 30 days free premium for free.
Here is a short summary of what works and what doesn't:
Works:

Login
Videos from the guide (7 day replay)
Recorded videos
Ondemand videos

Doesn't work:

Ondemand series (haven't tried to add this, maybe this can be done in a follow-up PR)
Live TV: The dash streams do get extracted successfully by using _extract_mpd_formats, but the streams cannot be downloaded. Here is the output that I get:

Reading the original PR (Youtube-DL#29160) might be useful, since the comments to that PR contain some discussion about the detailed design.

Description of your pull request and other information
The existing crunchyroll beta support simply parses the page enough to find the non-beta url, then hands off to the non-beta extractor. This no longer functions for premium content for US users, since the non-beta site forcibly redirects to the beta site. See #1911.
This implements direct support for crunchyroll beta through the API, but only when a login cookie is present. Otherwise, it hands off to the non-beta extractor as usual (this is in line with what happens with an actual browser as well).
Notes:

This is literally the first python code I have ever written. It's probably pretty horrible. I've tested that it works, but the way encoding issues are handled in python isn't familiar to me... I pretty much just tried random things until it started behaving as I wanted in that regard, so there might be problems hidden away there.
Probably could do with some better code formatting.
I don't know that my format generation behaves well in sufficiently many circumstances, though it behaves similarly to the non-beta crunchyroll extractor in my testing. It's mostly monkey-see-monkey-do from other extractors, rather than well-thought-out code.
It's rather unfortunate that there's nowhere to put crunchyroll's sequence_number metadata in yt-dlp. This would be awfully handy to have for reasonable filename generation, as some series on the site have non-integral episode numbers. See https://beta.crunchyroll.com/series/GEXH3W8G1/the-faraway-paladin for an example.
No series extractor at the moment, but the authorization structure is no different, so it's just a matter of interpreting the api's json output for api_domain + '/cms/v2' + bucket + '/series/' + series_id with the same query string.
There are quite a few different stream types I'm not looking at here. It's possible that a different group than adaptive_hls is the way to go.",3,8

Hardcodes some data that could be retrieved from self._LOGIN_URL if cloudflare wasn't so trigger-happy.
The data does appear to be constant, but I've left the retrieval method in comments so that if they do change, breakages can be easily fixed by anyone who can use a web browser's ""view source"" feature and knows a little python.
If anyone knows a way to reliably get around this and download the page, that would of course be preferable.

This should deal with issue #2519 , including the improvements I proposed. I have tested the changes in a couple of channels containing the problematic video IDs, plus a few livestreams, and everything seems to work as intended. Regarding the video IDs getting truncated in the download log, I must have misremembered it because I could not reproduce anything like that. The download archive seems to work normally.

Fixed _VALID_URL regex (now it looks explicitly for an optional third digit block in the video ID)
Added '__plataform=web' to cloudac queries. Now referers and access token cookies are probably no longer needed, but I do not dare remove the code yet. Just in case.
Added extra metadata: timestamp, duration and thumbnails for VODs, and timestamp (technically stream start time) for live streams.
Added graceful(-ish) failure if a video or channel is not found or if access is restricted, using raise_no_formats. It now returns a brief error message and the error code found in the json, and hides the exception details unless -v is used.",2,2

This PR fixes the following bugs:

On some Tumblr posts, extraction fails with a 403 Forbidden when trying to download the video iframe. (This was reported as youtube-dl issue 29585.)
Vimeo video is not detected, since it is wrapped in an iframe rather than embedded directly in the page.

It also updates the test cases.
(N.B.: the embedded Instagram video's duration is marked as 0.0. This is obviously incorrect, but it is actually what Instagram reports. Unauthenticated requests from yt-dlp get the sharedData structure and the bad duration; authenticated requests from yt-dlp, and unauthenticated requests from everything else I have tried, get the additionalData structure and no duration. I have given up debugging this due to Instagram's absurdly aggressive rate-limiting.)

Especially the <x(a|b|.+)+> pattern to detect attributes is terrible since it matches every x tag. The inability to use [^>] for script makes it worse and results in huge intermediate matches. Breaking up the regex makes memory use negligible while also giving 50-300x perf on random pages (from my naive profiling)

resolving #2523
I also added another subtitle track that notes when a screen share began or ended
a few issues I encountered in this extractor
the automatic password entering is no longer working, this is due to a new ""defense"" mechanism set by zoom
it include extra headers in the http request for the video page that are generated by a js file that is also generated based on a seed
example of the js code:
https://hdq-colman-ac.zoom.us/assets/zm_bundle.js?seed=AADx7N1-AQAAsr6kOeqMVkDZFrY_h7kUEdue172Pbg3WR8ywwtLBJedku_Fm&uQHR71Sqnk--z=q
I tried to crack it and got pretty far, but I want to close this feature first
we can bypass this issue by extracting cookies from the browser after entering the passcode ourselves, I use an extention because the --cookies-from-browser didn't work for me for some reason
another issue is that the zoom recording provided as test is no longer usable, it now requires a captcha and form filling to enter
so I removed it, I do not have a public meeting to replace it with
it maybe be usable if the test uses browser cookies after one registers to the zoom call from their browser, but I don't know how the test framework operates
also, I noticed that if I do not state output format and download all formats, they have the same name and so only one of them is downloaded, is that the intended behavior?",4,0

Description of your pull request and other information
This overhaul changes the underlying network request handling in yt-dlp.
The main goal of this was to abstract away all the network code to no longer directly interact with urllib for HTTP requests. This was so we could easily add support for more modern, updated HTTP libraries such as urllib3 to bring persistent connections, while also keeping our no-hard-dependency requirement.
TODO: https://github.com/coletdjnz/yt-dlp-dev/projects/2
Changes
The new HTTP networking interface:

Our own Request/Response/Exception classes that we have full control over.
Introduces RequestHandlers - these send supported HTTP requests and return HTTP responses
Introduces the RequestDirector - this allows us to use multiple RequestHandlers
This allows us to support multiple HTTP client libraries (each contained within a RequestHandler)

Other Improvements:

Fix issues with per request proxies on redirects for urllib
Cleaned up various legacy code
Support for ALL_PROXY env proxy setting (and all:// proxy setting to cover all protocols)
Support for socks5h (with socks5 being treated as socks5h in the ydl layer)

Closes #6325, ytdl-org/youtube-dl#22618, ytdl-org/youtube-dl#28093



Known issues / regressions

Expected: urllib (and requests) handlers check the proxy scheme to see check if it is supported.

urllib does not support https:// proxies, so it will not be able to handle a request with one.
Previously, urllib would erroneously treat https:// proxies as http:// proxies. It is possible some users have wrongly supplied an https:// proxy, so their configurations will break. We never supported https:// proxies and the behavior was undefined, so we should not have to support compat for this.


Expected: if a user has ALL_PROXY set for any other program, yt-dlp will now pick it up.
External extractors/downloaders etc. using urlopen() catching urllib exceptions other than HTTPError. We only provide compat for HTTPError, the others not. We could add compat but I imagine it is unlikely there would be an issue.

Future

Updating external downloaders to use ydl.proxies, clean_proxies and clean_headers
Requests support (#3668)

This PR fixes the following bugs:

Video height is not reported correctly.
Some videos are not extracted. (Newer Tumblr video posts may use a simple <video> element rather than the iframe the extractor currently expects.)

Incorrect video may be extracted instead. (If a post is <video>-based, but the extractor finds an iframe somewhere in the HTML—for example, in a 'related posts' section—it will target that instead, leading to surprising results.)


Login is out of date and no longer works.

In addition, it adds support for the API powering Tumblr's 'dashboard view', which is both the only way to view some posts and a good source of metadata. (Relatively little can be consistently extracted from the page HTML due to the arbitrary structure of Tumblr themes.)
It also updates the test cases.
Among the metadata available from the API is the content of the reblog chain, where applicable; I considered supplying this as comments but have not implemented it.
Thank you!",3,2

Closes #2930.
Also allows the crunchyroll beta extractors to operate when the display_id is the empty string, as I've observed to happen occasionally when videos don't have all their metadata set yet.
It currently functions at bare minimum, but there are some issues I'd like some feedback on.
The crunchyroll beta api divides the world up into series, which are further subdivided into seasons, which contain a sequence of episodes. Unfortunately, however, seasons don't get their own web urls.
Somewhat unintuitively, different audio formats (subbed, $lang dubbed) are represented as different seasons. The api provides is_subbed and is_dubbed in the list of seasons associated to a series, but as far as I can tell it does NOT provide a way to tell what language a season is dubbed in directly from that list, other than regexp-matching the season name, which isn't a very palatable option.
The current implementation just queries all seasons associated with a series and throws all the episodes together into one big list, which makes a bunch of unnecessary requests, as it's not uncommon to have ~10 different language dubs available.

I would like to implement some kind of reasonably usable method to select only the seasons you want (since most people only want one audio-language version, rather than all of them) and ideally only the episodes you want, without making a rediculous number of unnecessary requests. What should that look like? Keep in mind that episodes are not always whole-numbered, so the item number mechanisms won't always work well.
I would like to save the access token (what self._get_params outputs) rather than regenerate it for each episode, as it requires multiple sequential requests each time, but I'm not familiar enough with yt-dlp's architecture to have a good idea how to do that.
I have not tested it with other locales. The urls for individual episodes may not be generated correctly in those cases.
I would like to have the non-beta extractor detect crunchyroll redirecting to the beta site and switch extractors, rather than plow ahead assuming the page it got was right.",3,14

#1066 has a implementation error, io.open() may apply the O_TRUNC flag to the underlying openat() syscall, causing the truncation of a file before an advisory lock is obtained. In the case where some other process already holds an advisory lock, O_TRUNC violates it.

Come up a few times that using certifi for certificates may help solve some of the SSL issues we see (e.g. systems having no or outdated certificates).
I'm not very familiar with this area so feedback or review is appreciated 😃
Also suggestions for wording of docs, what I have is very rough and probably too technical explanation.
Added no-certifi compat-opt if there is a need to use system certificates (self signed?).",3,2

Accept-Encoding header should be set for each downloader to what it supports, whether that is for native or external.
This should fix #3142
notes/findings for reference:

httpie downloader automatically sets Accept-Encoding; it uses urllib3 underneath I believe.
wget only supports gzip encoding (so potential issue in youtube-dl)
Aria2cFD already adds the option to add gzip&deflate headers

This PR adds a fallback to extract the duration from the accessibility data.

This is an extractor for ITProTV. It requires authentication via cookies (due to reCAPTCHA) and most courses are behind a subscription. This extractor supports individual videos (episodes) and playlists (courses.)
The tests for the individual videos pass. Both tests for the playlists fail but the extractor is functional.
For test_ITProTVCourse, it fails with the error yt_dlp.utils.DownloadError: ERROR: ""url"" field is missing or empty - skipping format, there is an error in extractor; please report this issue on  https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp , filling out the appropriate issue template. Confirm you are on the latest version using  yt-dlp -U likely becuse one of the videos in the playlist does not have a url for the format represented at line 115. When downloading the playlist outside the context of the test, there is the warning WARNING: ""url"" field is missing or empty - skipping format, there is an error in extractor.
For test_ITProTVCourse_1, it fails with the error
AssertionError: 'beyond-tech' != 'time-management'
- beyond-tech
+ time-management
 : Invalid value for field id, expected 'beyond-tech', got 'time-management'

Description of your pull request and other information
The BiliIntlIE extractor is currently written to download content with a series and episode ID. I believe this is generally used for series that have been licensed from a studio (sometimes described as ""OGV"" in this market). This is similar to the operating model of, say, Netflix or Crunchyroll.
However, BiliBili also supports user-generated content (UGC). These videos have a slightly different URL structure, and pass slightly different API parameters (aid instead of ep_id/episode_id). This PR updates the extractor to support UGC videos, including:

a regex update
two match_only test cases
a tweak to the data extraction logic to match __INITIAL_STATE__ rather than __INITIAL_DATA__ on UGC video pages
updates to the API calls to support passing either aid or ep_id

I've manually tested that both OGV and UGC videos can be successfully downloaded with these changes. Note for others who may test this code: there seems to be a pre-existing issue with the extractor that causes sporadic 403 errors, at least for some users. As a workaround, you can retry the download.",2,1

Description
In a research project (https://github.com/zerodytrash/YouTube-Internal-Clients) I hammered the Innertube API with 8k requests in order to find a new age-gate bypass client. Turns out the client TVHTML5_SIMPLY_EMBEDDED_PLAYER with version 2.0 has no age restrictions in place and it seems to have the same success rate as  clientScreen:EMBED.
Request:
POST /youtubei/v1/player?key=AIzaSyAO_FJ2SlqU8Q4STEHLGCilw_Y9_11qcW8 HTTP/2
Host: www.youtube.com

{
    ""context"": {

        }
    },
    ""videoId"": ""dqRZDebPIGs"",
    ""racyCheckOk"": true,
    ""contentCheckOk"": true
}

Not sure if it still makes sense to try the clientScreen:EMBED clients (are they completely broken?)
I added the new bypass beside the existing one.",4,9

This add support for Trailers on Moviepilot. The whole topic is a little bit complicated:

Trailers aren't self hosted but hosted at Dailymotion (since 2 years or so).
Most movies link to a bunch of trailers, for example see Interstellar.
On the main movie site exactly one ""main"" trailer is played.

My extractor extracts this ""main"" trailer as playlist and forwards it to the Dailymotion extractor.
I'm not really sure, if this is a good method. Especially the test cases aren't really expressive because of that.
Moviepilot sometimes changes it's source code. Currently, the video ID of the ""main"" trailer is only mentioned in a script comment when retrieving the plain website, so I take this. I'm not sure how stable this is but every other method seems to need JS.",2,7

The v1 API code was removed for simplicity, even though it still mostly works. Not anymore. Not not anymore. Not not not anymore, the v1 API is now completely down (404).
I have left a number of ‘XXX’ comments in, please take a look before merging.
The testcases for this extractor are stale. I have not updated them, other than throwing away upload_date, which the updated code no longer extracts.

ytdl-org/youtube-dl#30878

To settle before merging:

 Whether to keep v1 API extraction (it looks like Arte has pulled the plug on the v1 API, so no, it seems) (probably not worth the trouble if even Arte themselves neglect it; plus, text subtitles in v2 API > burned-in subtitles in v1 API)
 Update testcases (I think good enough for now; videos may expire in the future, though)
 Language preference inferred from version label
 All the XXX comments

 Non-HLS protocols
 nulls for videos that are no longer available
 Whether rights is a good upload_date replacement (I say good enough)
 id vs providerId (decided to use providerId after all)
 extract chapters from stream['segments'] (deferred this one)


 Is stream['versions'] always a one-element list? (answer seems to be yes; even the host’s own player seems to assume so)
 Handling of https://api.arte.tv/api/player/v2/config/fr/LIVE

Description of your pull request and other information
Fragmented downloads can be speed up by using more threads. This makes the progress bar appear jittery as it is updated by each thread. This PR rewrites the logic, which summarizes the progress of each fragment and allows updates on the eta and speed calculation in separate intervals.

_start_frag_download() is locked while executed by a thread, thus avoiding inconsistent updates of nonlocal variables (ctx, status)
the progress is only updated in fixed intervals of 0.9 seconds
the calculation of speed and eta is done between the current time and about 3 seconds before, this is more accurate than the average over the whole download time - when you resume a download the last fragments can be read from temporary files which increases the speed but does not reflect the download speed from the server
the console title output of HttpQuietDownloader is suppressed as ist messes with the output of FragmentedFD
when Ctrl+C is pressed on concurrent downloads (N>1) emit a warning and shut down the ThreadPoolExecutor gracefully, waiting for pending fragments to finish

additional issue
yt-dlp doesn't detect, if a fragmented file was already fully downloaded. All fragments are downloaded again and appended to the existing file. This can be detected, when
ctx['fragment_index'] == 0 and resume_len > 0
One of the commits deals with it by warning and setting the file mode to wb. As it is not part of the actual problem it can be put into a separate PR.",5,29

Description of your pull request and other information
When you enable notifications on a channel, videos will show in the notification menu (the ""bell"") when videos are uploaded or go live. This extractor adds an option to get these video URLs with just a simple API call. Community posts and video comment replies may show up as notifications, but they should be ignored. It may be possible to extract from those posts/replies, but that was beyond my original goal for this new feature.
Continuations are supported. Since notifications can be practically endless, the extractor keyword has a value argument that specifies the maximum number of pages to fetch (each page has 20 real entries), with a sane default of 1 (i.e. no continuation). I haven't tested to see how far back it goes for fear of throttling, but I can fetch 20 pages (~400 entries) in 4 seconds.
Since this is an unusual part of the API being used, some commonly used methods were ignored; I tried to reuse as much as I could.
The extractor creates a playlist of URLs with just a bit of info added (provided thumbnail, original title, uploader, and video id). The benefit of this extractor is that private videos still show up, and they include the uploader and video title.
Some explanation for excluded fields:
Dates are relative and imprecise (e.g. ""1 day ago"") and may also be plainly inaccurate. The action in the message text (e.g. ""uploaded"", ""is live"") is not accurate (a livestream vod that was unprivated long after the stream ended would show as ""uploaded"", for example).
The included thumbnail is weird: for livestreams only, the height is set to 0. There is also the issue that without flat-playlist, this thumbnail is removed from the infodict's list of thumbnails entirely.
A few of the methods could potentially be inlined.

This one is a bit experimental
This adds support for downloading youtube stories, which are usually only accessible on mobile. However, with some magic we can view and download them on desktop youtube too 😉
Example story: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PNJCjXkrps&pp=8AEB
Example story playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chHM75fI770&list=RLTDwFCb4jeqaKWnciAYM-ZVHg&index=2&pp=8AEB
(note these example links will probably stop working due to the nature of stories)
By adding player parameter 8AEB, it enables stories to be viewable (I've added this to the links above).
I've currently hardcoded this to the webpage download & player ep requests. It doesn't seem to have an affect on normal videos but some thorough testing is probably required to be sure.
Currently only supports getting stories by channel id
ytstories:RLTDwFCb4jeqaKWnciAYM-ZVHg
ytstories:UCwFCb4jeqaKWnciAYM-ZVHg
(can also use the video id but these can be hard to get)
There is also an issue where the RLTD playlist is an unviewable playlist, but youtube incorrectly still provides a link to the /playlist page. So I've had to override that.
Also credit to Stellarator for helping figure this out 😃",2,3
