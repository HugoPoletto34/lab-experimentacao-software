There is also a problem that appears in the picture of Confusion Matrix. (I did not fix the picture in the commit)

The Actual Values should be presented by axis 0 and Predicted Values in axis 1. So that calculation results can match the classification_report with the correct definition of precision and recall.
Finally, The correct matrix should be:

Note of the translator: Portuguese has a gender typing and is generally masculine, so it was added in some sentences ""a person"" to make certain sentences without a gender and make the course more inclusive. Another note is that the word denigrate has a racist nature, which is why it was changed to defame.",2,3
