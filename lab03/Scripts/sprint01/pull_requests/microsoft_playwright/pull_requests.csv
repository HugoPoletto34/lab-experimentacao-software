But this was racey if something else would trigger an update, such as setting fixedLayout. This patch makes everything synchronous, by immediately calling setSize on the WebPageProxy before resizing the window with gtk.
In theory this might still have a race if you try to resize the window smaller than the smallest size allowed by gtk, but I'd argue that that is undefined behavior.

First of all, thanks a ton for all the work done on this awesome project!
I was looking at this issue #13 and immediately thought about giving the project a try and see how clicking on an CSS-animated element will behave. I have some solid experience with other e2e frameworks and clicking on an animated element is one of the most annoying thing to tackle.
It happens that this is already handled out of the box by playwright! I made a quick proof test to validate it, hence I created this small PR.
N.B.: I'd really love to contribute on fixing the aforementioned issue. Not sure though to fully get how the project wants to scope it. What I see as an issue is having e.g. a target you want to click on, hidden by some other animated div and then finally clickable.",3,3

How has this been tested?

Clone the repository including this patch
Create a sample project
Install local module as npm package with npm install -S /absolute-path/to/playwright
package.json should be like this:
""dependencies"": {
    ""playwright-core"": ""file:/path/to/playwright""
}

Create a main.js with following code:
const devices = require(""playwright-core"").devices

const deviceMap = new Map();
for (const device of devices) {
  deviceMap.set(device.name, device);
}

for (const name of deviceMap.keys()) {
  if (name.endsWith("" landscape"")) continue;
  const landscapeName = `${name} landscape`;
  if (!deviceMap.has(landscapeName)) {
    const landscapeDevice = deviceMap.get(name);
    const {width, height} = landscapeDevice.viewport;
    landscapeDevice.name = landscapeName;
    landscapeDevice.viewport.width = height;
    landscapeDevice.viewport.height = width;
    console.log(`Missing device for ""${landscapeName}"", expected: ${JSON.stringify(landscapeDevice,     null, 2)}`);
  }
}

It should not output log.

Refactor inter-process communication inside Firefox. The goal is
to have a single abstraction that works nicely for all our cross-process
communication needs (browser <-> content, content <-> workers, content
<-> file:// process, e.t.c.)
This is step 1 that eliminates content sessions everywhere.
Step 2 will move workers onto SimpleChannel as well.
This is a pre-requisite for #720: with a single browser <-> content
communication channel it will be easier to await permission change in tabs.
