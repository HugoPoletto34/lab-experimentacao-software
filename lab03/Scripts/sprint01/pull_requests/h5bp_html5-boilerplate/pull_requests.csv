.sh, ...) was missing an escape sequence on its dot.
As a result, in addition filtering problematic files, it also filtered
some very valid urls. For example:
mysite.com/blog        <- satisfies /.log$/ and gets filtered
mysite.com/hit-refresh <- satisfies /.sh$/ and gets filtered

This change modifies .htacces so the dot is interpreted as a literal dot
character, avoiding those issues.",5,3

The sentence “Include the following meta tag will unintrusively allow the user the option to download your iOS app” in extend.md lets me confused, I think the sentence doesn't quite make sense.I'd suggest:

Updated all dependencies, with the following ramifications:

Updating gulp-autoprefixer (which itself updated autoprefixer to v7) leads to a new prefix being added in dist/css/main.css.
Updating mocha to v4 required updating the npm test script (the --compilers flag was deprecated between v3 and v4).
The babel-related flag in npm test was also updated to match current syntax.


Several updates to: .travis.yml:

Tests now run on Ubuntu 14.04 (trusty) instead of 12.04 (precise, the previous default.)
Node 8 and 9 have been added and Node 7 has been removed as it has now reached EoL.


Trimmed trailing whitespace in two lines of CHANGELOG.md
Changes to dist:

In addition to the new css prefix, running a rebuild added previously-committed docs sections not reflected in dist (i.e. humans.txt) and added the shrink-to-fit=no meta tag to dist/index.html.",3,1

Hi I saw your tweet and the issue #2150. I did the migration to Gulp 4. You can test by yourself to check if it's the intended behaviour. It should I did not change that much.
What I did exactly:

Updated some dev dependencies used in gulp
Changed the babel node modules to be compatible with Gulp V4
Updated the babel config inside the package.json
Moved Autoprefixer browserlist config from gulpfile to the package.json

My node version: v10.15.4 and npm: 6.9.0. I don't know if the projects now works for ""node"": "">=8"" and ""npm"": "">=3"". Maybe we need to update the engine config aswell.
