Changes:
Swap out the password generator for a native NodeJS CSPRNG method

Test Environment:
OS: Mac OS High Sierra (10.13.6)

Caveats:
None that I can think of. Although this did lead me to discover another issue. The input component has no error states for an incorrect password. (I'll open a new issue for this and style it to match what we currently have on our hosted services)

Fixes #60 by adding support for Kubernetes. This deploys code-server, Contour for ingress controller, and Cert Manager for Let's Encrypt certificates, with persistent storage with AWS EBS volumes. Also, I left the Dockerfile I used for golang development. If there's a public push of this somewhere it would be great to document how you can create base images with the right tooling up front.
This is also somewhat opiononated in that it's using AWS EBS volumes, but can be adapted for many use cases. I wasn't sure how that might get organized within the repo.

Proxies are advantageous mainly they allow us to share interfaces between the client and server (it's even better now because it just uses the actual class so we don't even need to maintain any interfaces), and they also allow code like:

I don't think we should encourage users to run this as sudo just to get it working on a root port., especially since the target audience of these guides are people with little server admin experience.
Additionally, this PR makes the insecure certificate guide apply to Firefox in addition to just Chrome, changes the AWS AMI image to 18.04 to match the DO guide (which doesn't specify an Ubuntu version, DO defaults to 18.04), and removes the AWS AMI ID as I think it's different for every AWS region.

It should be much easier to upgrade VS Code versions now and it'll fix a decent number of issues. As the web portion of VS Code matures we'll be able to shrink our patch and maybe even remove it entirely or almost entirely.
There are also some differences in defaults. Mainly things have been made additive instead of subtractive.

HTTP instead of HTTPS.
No password instead of password. (Have since changed this back.)
Default port is now 8080.
No longer opens the cwd if no path is given.

Flags have changed:

--auth password to enable password authentication. The idea here is to eventually support other authentication methods.
HTTPS is enabled automatically if you pass in certificates; no need for a separate flag to toggle it.
VS Code options have been inherited so there are some differences there.
VS Code does not error on unknown options so code-server no longer does either.

I think v2 is on par feature-wise with v1 except:

 Can't upload vsix files. (1.37.0 added this)
 Extension profiling is disabled.
 Extension tips are disabled.
 Running tasks doesn't work. (fixed)
 Can't upload files. (implemented)

Todo:

 Look into service worker error when using a base path (just need to adjust the scope).
 Use current page URL for the webview URL instead of trying to figure it out on the server's end.
 Fix Ctrl + K + O issue.
 General testing.

The next big thing will be to get language support working which I think should be pretty easy now (that's another big benefit to this rewrite). (Implemented.)
This time around for the patch I opted to keep context because I found that no context made upgrading tricky in the past.

Fixes #241.

I've made 1 opinionated decision for the persistence storage, by keeping persistent /home/coder/project and /home/coder/.local/share/code-server directory which basically contains all the vscode configurations, such as extensions, settings etc.
The helm chart includes an extensive README that should cover all the aspects to install and configure code-server.
The helm chart is now compatible with the latest stable version, but once the v2 will be out, the helm chart can be updated accordingly (it's just a matter of changing the port for now).

The authentication password is stored in plain-text in a cookie named password.
Some may not see this as a security issue for automatically generated passwords (although bad practice) but it is definitively an issue when setting a custom password.
Therefore switching from a plain-text stored password to a SHA256 hash is a quick first step in the right direction (aka. I agree it could be better, eg. salted hash).
I saw that there are pull requests providing other solutions (eg. #931 ) for authentication methods which were blocked by GH-857, but really think this pull request should be merged in for the next v1 release.

Currently the path to the app icon from manifest.json 404s; this icon was removed at some point from the repository. And so, when installing the web app from a browser (desktop or mobile), the app icon is absent. This update adds back the largest icon from a previous commit, and references it from manifest.json. The path to the icon includes the static/out/vs/server/src/media directory, since not everything from that folder gets copied into the app root directory.
Additionally, a <link> tag (to enable iOS devices to also pick up the app icon) was added to both the main workbench.html file and the login page.

To do this, you pass a domain on the command line. For example:
code-server --proxy-domain coder.com --proxy-domain test.coder.com

Domains can be in the format coder.com or *.coder.com and the flag can be repeated to add as many domains as you want.
When code-server encounters [number].[domain] in the host header it'll proxy to the port indicated by [number] if [domain] matches one of the provided proxy domains. For example, going to 8080.coder.com in this example would proxy code-server to itself.
When authenticating the cookie will be set against the highest-level proxy. So in this example if you logged in at 8080.test.coder.com the cookie would be set against coder.com since that's the highest level that matches in the provided list of domains. That way you only have to authenticate once.

Bug Fixes


Hopefully this one fixes autoupdates from 3.2.0 once and for all.

We're now publishing duplicate releases without the v prefix so that auto updates from 3.2.0 work. See #1746 and #1758 for background.
Note there is no auto updating in any of the recent releases including this one.



The config file's extension-dir and data-dir parameters are now properly obeyed #1750

This was supposed to be fixed in the last release but because of a subtle bug it turned out it was printing the correct directories but not actually using them.
It should now use extension-dir and data-dir as set in the config file



We do not bundle any dynamic libraries in releases anymore #1738

It was causing bizarre issues for users and we couldn't make it work perfectly.
On Linux we now compile on CentOS 7 so that the minimum glibc version is v2.17 and glibcxx is v3.4.18
On macOS we now pull in a fully static release of node.



Using the deprecated root code-server symlink now warns on usage that it will be removed in the next few weeks.

The entry script now also handles recursive symlinks correctly.



globalStorageHome is now created on startup #1693 so that extensions that rely on it being there should work now",3,2

Previously we only deleted PASSWORD in the child process but now it's deleted in the parent (which I think is good since that means it'll be hidden from the VS Code CLI spawn as well and anything else we might spawn from the parent in the future).
But as a consequence the child no longer has access to PASSWORD and can't use it when parsing the arguments. This PR fixes that by passing the arguments from the parent to the child.
As a bonus this means we only have to do the parsing once, including if it gets restarted via a SIGUSR1.

There's quite a few things that may be slightly hacky about it, since VSCode's extension gallery design is confusingly broken:

galleryUrl is used for /extensionquery and uninstall statistics
itemUrl is supposedly used for linking to item pages but is not essential for functionality (and our gallery doesn't support it) so I just left it out
controlUrl appears to be used for reporting malicious extensions, neither OpenVSX nor our gallery supports this
recommendationsUrl provides recommendations but neither OpenVSX nor our gallery supports this

Awkward thing here is that galleryUrl on first glance appears to be the base URL for the whole API, and internally /extensionquery is appended to it, but then they go ahead and include separate URLs for other extension gallery functionality - which is quite confusing.
So, I just changed the type of galleryUrl from string to string[] and patched the methods that read from it.
It might also be possible to change the type of extensionGallery to a list of objects instead of an object with a list of galleryUrl - but given that the other variables aren't really used by either of the two galleries we plan to primarily support (ours and OpenVSX's), so I tried to minimize engineering time there.
I've tested the result by installing extensions from both OpenVSX and our repo - and it works fine!
Also, right now, I don't actually resort results to merge the two lists; it's just all of OpenVSX's first page, with all of Coder's (with duplicates filtered) after that.",2,3

Changes

Additional Notes
Right now, yarn test runs both the unit and the e2e tests. This means it will fail locally if you do not have code-server running. In the future, we should consider separating the tests. We could have test:unit and test:e2e and then have separate jobs for each in ci.

Note
I had to merge main in (commit: Merge branch 'main' into jsjoeio/upgrade-vscode-1.54) instead of rebasing because the vscode update is gigantic and it would be impossible to fix all those merge conflicts manually.",3,5

requests opened against the main branch. This is a subtle change
in behavior because, previously, builds would've run on pushes to
any branch, regardless if a pull request is open yet.
Update to GitHub actions/checkout v2, which performs a shallow
clone by default, which should speed up the build.

Closes: #2559 (:crossed_fingers:)

I believe that this should work, since only one job receives secrets according to the workflow definition (unless there's an administrative setting somewhere for global secrets passed using environment variables). However, I think the only way to be certain is to merge this and then open a pull request from a fork. If this breaks things or doesn't work correctly, we can always revert and try again.",3,0

Into:

}
The ""prettier"" config now includes not just ESLint core rules, but also rules from all plugins. Much simpler!
So … what’s the catch? Why haven’t we done this earlier? Turns out it’s just a sad mistake. I (@​lydell) was confused when testing, and thought that turning off unknown rules in a config was an error. Thanks to Georgii Dolzhykov (@​thorn0) for pointing this out!
If you use [eslint-plugin-prettier], all you need is [plugin:prettier/recommended]:

{
  ""extends"": [
    ""some-other-config-you-use"",

Release notes
Sourced from azure/setup-helm's releases.

New versioning logic for Helm releases uses GraphQL to fetch the last 100 releases of Helm. It then filters out the release as specified in the input. If 3.* has been specified, it'll get the latest Helm 3 release. Similarly if 2.* has been specified, it'll get the latest Helm 2 release. In case of latest, it'll fetch the latest Helm 3 release (to keep the behaviour consistent with previous action release).

Other handy features:

use --repeat-each to repeat the test suite multiple times

Major changes:

only videos for failed tests are saved
playwright-test automatically retries failed tests (3 times locally, 2 times in CI)
now runs tests in all three browsers (before Chromium. now WebKit and Firefox)

It should allow for a more flexible configuration and help us identify flaky tests faster.
Screenshot

TODOs

 fix flaky tests
 fix failing tests
 fix logs to not say jest in globalSetup

Notes
logout is flaky/failing because of the login rate limiter (#2647) :( See video:

Right now, the workflow looks a bit like this:

Issue comes in, assign to ""triage"" and ad relevant labels.
Once triaged is moved to next, it means we are working on it.
It may also get added to a version milestone if it will be out before that milestone is released.

We also have some work being added to the ""On Deck"" milestone. We would like to reduce any duplicate efforts and align ourselves with one process.
Proposed Workflow
Use milestones instead of project boards (similar to how vscode does it).
Create the following milestones:

""Backlog"" -> Work not yet planned for a specific release.
""On Deck"" -> Work under consideration for upcoming milestones
""Backlog Candidates"" -> Work that is not yet accepted for the Backlog. We wait for the community to weigh in

Month milestones make more sense than version milestones because in the event that a milestone has work that affects the version then we'd need to change the milestone name.
Pros

Milestones live closer to the issues
Milestones have progress indicators (open vs. closed in milestones)
Milestones can have due dates
Milestones can have descriptions

Cons

Issues can be attached to multiple milestones. This could lead to problems (potentially).

Proposed Changes
Once we this PR is approved, these are the changes I (@jsjoeio) will own and take care of as part of this process:

 Create ""Backlog"" milestone
 Create ""Backlog Candidates"" milestone
 Move all issues under ""triage"" in code-server project board to ""Backlog"" milestone
 Move all issues under ""Next"" in code-server project board to ""On Deck"" milestone (if not already in version milestone)

Follow-up

It's failing because it's either not receiving the full echo command or hitting enter before it receives the full command.

It allows to pass template with a list of containers to execute before

all init containers are  completed (exited with 0 code).
Additionally changes the way extraContainers is used - instead of
toYaml use tpl, because this allows to
reference any values from extraContainers string.

Questions about this release?  Ask in the official discussion thread: #1337
Breaking changes are prefixed with [BREAKING]
Added

Adds --show-config to log the resolved configuration (docs) (#1100, #1243)
Bundle and re-export @​tsconfig/node* configurations for convenience (docs) (#1202, #1236, #1313)
Default to appropriate @​tsconfig/node* configuration based on node and typescript versions (docs) (#1202, #1236, #1313)
Automatically reference @​types/node; use globally-installed @​types/node if not locally installed (#1240, #1257)
Add swc integration and new --transpiler option to use third-party transpilers for a massive speed boost on large codebases (docs) (#779, #1160)
Add scopeDir API option (docs) (#1155)
Add projectSearchDir API option (docs) (#1155)
Add --cwd-mode and ts-node-cwd to resolve config file relative to cwd, not entrypoint script (#1155)

Changed

[BREAKING] Make --script-mode default behavior; resolve tsconfig relative to entrypoint script instead of cwd (#949, #1197, #1155)

In most cases this change will have no noticeable effect
Primarily benefits portable shell scripts on your $PATH, because ts-node will respect the script's local tsconfig.json
Use --cwd-mode or ts-node-cwd if you need legacy behavior


[BREAKING] ignore rules evaluate relative to tsconfig.json directory, otherwise cwd (#1155)
[BREAKING] Remove support for node 10.  Minimum supported version is node 12 (#1312)
Rename --dir to --cwd; rename TS_NODE_DIR to TS_NODE_CWD (#1155)

--dir and TS_NODE_DIR are deprecated but still parsed for backwards-compatibility
--dir effectively changed the working directory of ts-node; renaming makes this behavior more obvious



Deprecated

Deprecate TS_NODE_SCOPE (#1155)
Deprecate --dir and TS_NODE_DIR (#1155)

Removed

[BREAKING] Internal APIs removed from type declarations (#1242)

Removed DEFAULTS, normalizeSlashes, parse, split
No features were removed
This will only affect consumers of ts-node's programmatic API



Fixed

[BREAKING] Fix #1229 and #1235: always throw ERR_REQUIRE_ESM when attempting to execute ESM as CJS, even when not using --loader ts-node/esm (#1232)

This aligns our behavior with vanilla node


[BREAKING] Fix #1225: compiler is loaded relative to tsconfig.json instead of entrypoint script (#1155)

In most cases this change will have no noticable effect


Fix #1217: REPL not always using passed stdout and stderr (#1224)
Fix #1220: ts-node ./index may execute the wrong file extension because tsconfig search poisons the require.resolve cache (#1155)
Fix #1322: Sourcemaps fail for filenames with spaces or other characters which are percent-encoded in URLs (#1160, #1330)
Fix #1331: Resolution of node builtin modules in ESM loader fails on node >=12.20.0, <13 (#1332)

Additional Context
Problem
When we publish a new release, we run a script to bump the formula for code-server on homebrew. The script works using cdrci's GitHub token (secret in repo) so that the PR comes from them and not a maintainer.
The problem is bump-formula-pr uses the user's homebrew-core fork.
This means we need to ensure the fork is up-to-date.
To do that, we need to pull the remote and push the changes to the fork before running bump-formula-pr.
We tried to see if it would ""just work"" by pulling and pushing, but the push command asks for a username and password.
Solution
You can get around this with --all. We found this solution here.

This has the advantage that the password won't be visible in the process list too.

Changes

update brew-bump.sh

Screenshots
Tested locally and this new approach should work.

Release notes
Sourced from ws's releases.

7.4.6
Bug fixes

Fixed a ReDoS vulnerability (00c425ec).

A specially crafted value of the Sec-Websocket-Protocol header could be used
to significantly slow down a ws server.
for (const length of [1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, 16000, 32000]) {
  const value = 'b' + ' '.repeat(length) + 'x';
  const start = process.hrtime.bigint();
value.trim().split(/ *, */);
const end = process.hrtime.bigint();
console.log('length = %d, time = %f ns', length, end - start);
}
The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed along with a fix in private by
Robert McLaughlin from University of California, Santa Barbara.
In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated by reducing the maximum
allowed length of the request headers using the --max-http-header-size=size
and/or the maxHeaderSize options.

Release notes

7.4.6
Bug fixes

Fixed a ReDoS vulnerability (00c425ec).

A specially crafted value of the Sec-Websocket-Protocol header could be used
to significantly slow down a ws server.
for (const length of [1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, 16000, 32000]) {
  const value = 'b' + ' '.repeat(length) + 'x';
  const start = process.hrtime.bigint();
value.trim().split(/ *, */);
const end = process.hrtime.bigint();
console.log('length = %d, time = %f ns', length, end - start);
}
The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed along with a fix in private by
Robert McLaughlin from University of California, Santa Barbara.
In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated by reducing the maximum
allowed length of the request headers using the --max-http-header-size=size
and/or the maxHeaderSize options.

Originally, we needed to upgrade Parcel from v1 to v2 due to maintainers deprecating v1 and a bunch of security vulnerabilities that we couldn't patch in v1. We were going to use v2 but it has breaking changes. So we decided to replace it with browserify which is a bit more lightweight and does the same thing.
Changes

remove parcel
use tsc to compile .ts files and browserify to bundle a few files used in the browser
reference css files directly in HTML instead of including with js bundles
remove minification of browser files (issues with es2015+ support using browserify plugin tinyify)
add codecov.yml which allows us to override some default settings

Originally, we needed to upgrade Parcel from v1 to v2 due to maintainers deprecating v1 and a bunch of security vulnerabilities that we couldn't patch in v1. We were going to use v2 but it has breaking changes. So we decided to replace it with browserify which is a bit more lightweight and does the same thing.
Changes

remove parcel
use tsc to compile .ts files and browserify to bundle a few files used in the browser
reference css files directly in HTML instead of including with js bundles
remove minification of browser files (issues with es2015+ support using browserify plugin tinyify)

7.5.1
Bug fixes

Fixed an issue that prevented the connection from being closed properly if an
error occurred simultaneously on both peers (b434b9f1).

7.5.0
Features

Some errors now have a code property describing the specific type of error
that has occurred (#1901).

Bug fixes

A close frame is now sent to the remote peer if an error (such as a data
framing error) occurs (8806aa9a).
The close code is now always 1006 if no close frame is received, even if the
connection is closed due to an error (8806aa9a).

It also throws an error if something goes wrong with the .verify() function.
Why do we need to add this?
The other day I noticed this error: 'TypeError: pchstr must contain a $ as first char\n'
I believe it happens because we're still in between a migration from the old hashing function sha256 to the new one argon2. And locally, I switch between the latest code-server and the development one. This means it may be calling the function to verify the hash expecting it to be a hash made with argon2 and instead it's made with sha256.
Once we release the newest version of code-server with the argon2 algorithm, we don't want it to throw unexpected errors, like this one. We may need to revisit some of the logic for verifying password hashes in case there are issues.
Either way, this adds an extra check to prevent this error from happening.

Our arch function doesn't recognize 32-bit Alpine, which fallsback to npm/yarn install (which is why it works on 32-bit Alpine), but tries to use the standalone install for 64-bit, which doesn't work.
This fixes that.

Process
To do this, we use a tool called depcheck. Locally, I ran npx depcheck --ignore-patterns=lib,dist,coverage,contrib which gave the following output:
Unused dependencies
* argon2
* env-paths
* node-fetch
* pem
* safe-buffer
* safe-compare
* tar-stream
* xdg-basedir
Unused devDependencies
* @types/pem
* @types/safe-compare
* @types/tar-stream
* @types/wtfnode
* audit-ci
* doctoc
* eslint-import-resolver-alias
* leaked-handles
* prettier-plugin-sh
* shellcheck
* stylelint
* stylelint-config-recommended
* wtfnode
Missing dependencies
* express-serve-static-core: ./typings/pluginapi.d.ts

Most of these are false-positives. I've identified the ones we no longer used and removed them as part of this PR. I've corrected this list and added more about how we use each dependency:
False positives
* @types/pem
* @types/safe-compare
* @types/tar-stream
* argon2 - used to hash passwords
* doctoc - used to generate table of contents in .md files
* audit-ci - used to identify vulnerabilities as part of CI
* env-paths - used to get environment paths
* pem - used to generate certificates 
* safe-compare - used to check if legacy hash & password are a match
* xdg-basedir - used when determining environment paths
* prettier-plugin-sh - formats shell files with prettier
* shellcheck - used to lint shell files
* stylelint - used for linting
* stylelint-config-recommended - used for linting

Moved Dependencies
* @types/wtfnode
* node-fetch - used as a testing dependency (moved out of root `package.json`) 
* wtfnode - used as a testing dependency (moved out of root `package.json`) 

Removed
* safe-buffer
* tar-stream

7.5.3
Bug fixes

The WebSocketServer constructor now throws an error if more than one of the
noServer, server, and port options are specefied (66e58d27).
Fixed a bug where a 'close' event was emitted by a WebSocketServer before
the internal HTTP/S server was actually closed (5a587304).
Fixed a bug that allowed WebSocket connections to be established after
WebSocketServer.prototype.close() was called (772236a1).

Release notes

v10.1.0
Questions about this release? Ask in the official discussion thread: #1390
Added

Add ""moduleType"" option to override module type -- CommonJS or ECMAScript -- on select files. (docs) (#1342, #1371, #1376)

Useful when a configuration file, for example webpack.config.ts, must execute as CommonJS but the rest of the project is ESM
selectively overrides package.json ""type"" and tsconfig.json ""module""
akin to .cjs and .mjs extensions, but for .ts and .tsx files
thanks to @​jayaddison for help on test coverage


Implement ""extends"" support for ""ts-node"" options in tsconfig.json (#1328, #1356)

""ts-node"": {} options will be parsed from extended tsconfigs
allows sharing and deduplicating ts-node configuration


Un-deprecate scope and scopeDir; add both to CLI and tsconfig.json options; un-deprecate TS_NODE_SCOPE env var; add TS_NODE_SCOPE_DIR env var (docs) (#1346, #1367)

Changed

Improve error messages thrown by native ESM loader hooks (#1357, #1373) @​tars0x9752

messages more closely match node; are more descriptive


Emit ""ts-node"" object at the top of --showConfig output instead of the bottom (#1355)

Fixed

Fix #1282: Set correct globals in [stdin], [eval], and <repl> contexts (#1333)

More closely align ts-node's behavior with vanilla node
Affects the interactive REPL, piping to stdin, and ts-node -e
Matches node's behavior for globals __filename, __dirname, module and sub-fields of module, exports, and builtin module aliases fs, etc


Fix #1343: Set swc option keepClassNames to true (#1344)
Fix: #1387: REPL outputs 'use strict' after first empty line of input (#1388) @​ejose19

Docs

Update ESM docs to say that env vars are supported with node --loader ts-node/esm (docs) (#1379)

Release notes
Sourced from yarn's releases.

v1.22.11
This version fixes a problem where Yarn wasn't forwarding SIGTERM to the binary spawned via yarnPath. It also makes yarn init -2 compatible with Corepack. The behaviour of yarn init (without -2) doesn't change.
Remember that Yarn 1.x won't receive further functional improvements. We recommend you to switch to the recently-released 3.0, and to ping us on Discord if you find issues when migrating (also check our Migration Guide).

Breaking changes


The WebSocket constructor now throws a SyntaxError if any of the
subprotocol names are invalid or duplicated (0aecf0c).


The server now aborts the opening handshake if an invalid
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol header field value is received (1877dde).


The protocols argument of handleProtocols hook is no longer an Array but
a Set (1877dde).


The opening handshake is now aborted if the Sec-WebSocket-Extensions header
field value is empty or it begins or ends with a white space (e814110).


Dropped support for Node.js < 10.0.0 (552b506).


The WebSocket constructor now throws a SyntaxError if the connection URL
contains a fragment identifier or if the URL's protocol is not one of 'ws:',
'wss:', or 'ws+unix:' (ebea038).


Text messages and close reasons are no longer decoded to strings. They are
passed as Buffers to the listeners of their respective events. The listeners
of the 'message' event now take a boolean argument specifying whether or not
the message is binary (e173423).
Existing code can be migrated by decoding the buffer explicitly.
websocket.on('message', function message(data, isBinary) {
  const message = isBinary ? data : data.toString();
  // Continue as before.
});

websocket.on('close', function close(code, data) {
  const reason = data.toString();
  // Continue as before.
});


The package now uses an ES module wrapper (78adf5f).


WebSocketServer.prototype.close() no longer closes existing connections
(df7de57).
Existing code can be migrated by closing the connections manually.
websocketServer.close();
for (const ws of websocketServer.clients) {
  ws.terminate();
}


The callback of WebSocketServer.prototype.close() is now called with an
error if the server is already closed (abde9cf).


WebSocket.prototype.addEventListener() is now a noop if the type argument
is not one of 'close', 'error', 'message', or 'open' (a421eb5).


WebSocket.prototype.removeEventListener() now only removes listeners added
with WebSocket.prototype.addEventListener() and only one at time (1bd93f0).


The value of the onclose, onerror, onmessage, and onopen properties is
now null if the respective event handler is not set (45790db).


The OpenEvent class has been removed (c4394c3).


Bug fixes

The event listeners added via handler properties are now independent from the
event listeners added with WebSocket.prototype.addEventListener()
(0b21c03).

Plus, using the specific version like v3.11.1 means it will auto-update with your release-prep script. Using v3.11.* would make it more difficult.

As an extra, I'd suggest using the latest path rather than a specific version

Why are we doing this?
As you may have see in the 3.11.1 discussion, we had a hiccup publishing the latest version to npm/Homebrew. This is because npm recently made a change to their package requirements, disallowing symlinks in packages.
Fortunately, we don't need the symlink in the npm package release of code-server.
We originally thought we could remove the symlink all together, but after chatting with @code-asher, we realized we still need it for the standalone releases.
Fixing it
We had two options to fix it:

copy .gitignore to the npm package before bundling up
add .npmignore to the npm package and include the symlink

We opted to go with Option 2 because:

it's a single line in the publish-npm.sh
it's a solution that's isolating to the problem (i.e. copying the .gitignore could have unintended consequences)

Test plan

make changes
build a release, e.g. what we publish on npm
try publishing under individual scope (@jsjoeio/code-server)
test locally to ensure code-servers works, including ripgrep (used in file search)
