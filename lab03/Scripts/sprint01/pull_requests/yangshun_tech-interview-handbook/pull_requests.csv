The current method for traversing graphs (represented as 2D grids) shows a
recursive implementation. I'm following an iterative implementation that uses
deque data structure which can function as either a queue (for BFS) and
stack (for DFS) to provide more effecient insertion and deletion operations.
Using namedtuple data structure to use x or y to access coordinates in
place of indices.
Add a placeholder function is_valid to check for those cells that may be
invalid (this function will vary as per what the question requires)
Insert into the deque first and check if the nodes are valid later(as
opposed to checking boundary conditions and visited/valid seperately)",3,5

Alice is an Engineering Manager with 10 years of professional experience.

Store this filePath in the database

Notes:

By default I am storing the files on public/ storage, since I recalled we discussed that files should be public
Supabase client is only on server, no db info is exposed to client

File download Flow:

User lands on resumes/[resumeId] page
GET request /api/file-storage with key=resumes&url=filePath
API route downloads file from supabase client
Returns file as bytes buffer, which is then set as a Blob file on client",2,1
