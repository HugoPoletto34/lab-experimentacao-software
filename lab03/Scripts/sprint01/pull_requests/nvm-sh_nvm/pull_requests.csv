1308,2016-11-14T19:38:45Z,,2016-11-21T10:01:07Z,4,81,42,"I use zsh-nvm (lazy-loaded) and direnv. I set up an .envrc that sources nvm.sh and then executes nvm use (.nvmrc file in the directory). This works fine.
However, as soon as I actually then execute any nvm, npm, or globally installed node cli modules, the lazy loader kicks in and sources nvm.sh, which executes nvm_auto. When nvm_auto is executed, it doesn't take into account that nvm may have already loaded a specific version of node before that. (The reason it's not loaded yet even though it's been executed already by direnv is because direnv spawns a separate sub-shell to do its work.)
The first commit fixes that, by checking in nvm_auto whether the current nvm version is system or not.
Somehow this is causing a lot of tests to fail in zsh (although in practice it works just fine in zsh). I can't for the life of me figure out why. Please comment on what I need to do to make them pass and I'll do it.
Secondly, in the case where nvm loads a version of node, and then the path is prepended to by another process, nvm should not mungle the path order when loading a new version of nvm.
E.g. in my direnv example I prepend ""$(npm bin)"" to the path after loading nvm.sh and executing nvm use. This means that if there are locally installed as well as globally installed npm cli executables, the shell will prefer the locally installed versions. This makes sense, it's a nice way for projects not to have to worry whether the globally installed version is correct.
However, as soon as nvm changes the path, either because nvm use <version> is executed, or in my case, the lazy loader kicks in and sources and loads nvm (this time with the correct version of node, thanks to the first commit), nvm strips the nvm-specific parts of the path, and then prepends the new versions of the nvm path to the path. This means that now, globally installed versions of node cli executables will be preferred by the shell. This is not good. It'd be better to respect a user's path ordering.
The second commit fixes that. nvm_prepend_path is removed. nvm_change_path is added. Test included. nvm_change_path prepends if there are no current nvm-specific parts of the path, otherwise it'll replace the nvm-specific part of the path, leaving the path order intact.",2,8

I found a bug in nvm_install_node function, it overrides the variable NODE_VERSION, which blocks the installation of node in the install.sh script! More details below..
I did some tests locally with the install.sh script, and the I found that the problem in in the function nvm_install_node in install.sh script.
One solution is to change the name of the local variable to something other than NODE_VERSION
You could test it using these 2 scripts:
I ran tests on ubuntu 16.04 servers

Current version [0.33.6] test script:
export NODE_VERSION=8 && sudo curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.6/install.sh | bash

Expected result: nvm should install node 8

I wrote a test for it, and ran ""test/install_script"" on original repo and my fix, and surprisingly the test passes on both!! (https://github.com/Quadric/nvm/blob/fix-node-version-in-install-script/test/install_script/nvm_install_with_node_version), it doesn't change the fact that it still fails when I provision an AWS AMI with packer or when I run the script directly on the newly created machine!

This pull request reduces CPU time from 50ms to 15ms.
What was done:

I have changed command printf on echo because printf is slower than echo
(printf - 2ms, echo - 0.09ms)
#1695 (comment)
Replace while cycle from nvm_tree_contains_path on string comparison
(while - 14ms, str comparison - 0.06ms)
Changed getting node version in nvm_ls_current from node --version to getting it from NVM_LS_CURRENT_NODE_PATH.
(node --version - 13ms, from string - 0.09ms)

The install command code separates processing parameters into 2 groups.
Main group [-s, -j, --no-progress, --lts, --lts=*, --latest-npm]
Additional group [--reinstall-packages-from=*, --copy-packages-from=*, --skip-default-packages]
The issue is that between processing these groups it was also grabbing a parameter interpreted as a version# to be installed.

$ cd ~/.nvm/test/fast/'Listing versions'

nvm debug output:






nvm ls output:






How did you install nvm? (e.g. install script in readme, Homebrew): Install script


What steps did you perform? Ran the wget install script


What happened? $NVM_DIR was set to nvm


What did you expect to happen? $NVM_DIR should be set to .nvm
I added the following line from the README to my .zshrc:


export NVM_DIR=""${XDG_CONFIG_HOME/:-$HOME/.}nvm""
[ -s ""$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"" ] && \. ""$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"" # This loads nvm

I couldn't figure out why nvm wasn't loading, until I realized that
echo NVM_DIR=""${XDG_CONFIG_HOME/:-$HOME/.}nvm"" outputs NVM_DIR=nvm.
Changing the line to export NVM_DIR=""${XDG_CONFIG_HOME/:-$HOME/}.nvm"" fixed the problem. This outputs NVM_DIR=.nvm as expected. I tested this and the same behavior holds true in Bash as well.

Is there anything in any of your profile files (.bashrc, .bash_profile, .zshrc, etc) that modifies the PATH? Nope

If  $MANPATH  is  set,  manpath  displays its value rather than determining it on the fly.  If $MANPATH is prefixed by a colon, then the value of the variable is appended to the list determined from the content of  the  configuration  files. If  the  colon comes at the end of the value in the variable, then the determined list is appended to the content of the variable.  If the value of the variable contains a double colon (::), then the determined list is inserted in the middle of the value, between the two colons.

I opted for NVM_INC as opposed to NVM_INCLUDE just because all the other NVM env vars were 3 characters or less.

If so, then change HOST_ARCH to x64 so that NVM will fetch x64 arch package from node repository which is the only package node currently having for darwin systems but no arm64 based packages
Problem

Macbook M1 ARM64 architecture problem that does not allow us to use default terminal for installing node packages using nvm, please refer here
What we did was use a rosetta-2 terminal for installing different node versions using NVM. It was creating problems for automation developers who use scripts to run operations, and it was not always possible to run the script on a single installed version of the node.
Even by transforming the current shell to a different arch using rosetta2 e.g, arch -x86_64 zsh causing problems as it creates a new instance of the terminal that is indirectly equivalent to using a different terminal i.e, rosetta one, which stops execution of next series of commands if it is invoked inside the script

Solutions Available

Use the latest version node as old ones were not built for mac m1 arch.
Use rosetta2 terminal to install node version as it converts architecture from arm64 to amd64, which then nvm install node packages for amd64
Solution Provided by me for automation engineers who don't want to switch on rosetta2 terminal just for installing node versions, Please refer this. Complete consequences explained in detail

Solution

Made changes in nvm.sh file to update nvm_get_download_slug() function that basically gathers architecture information regarding users system.
Basically rosetta was only being used to change architecture so that nvm_get_download_slug() would get x86_64 instead of arm64 architecture. Because older versions were never designed for arm64 architectures.
This part was the pain and I added conditions for the same, so that if the device is apple-based with silicon chip then it will set ""x64"" arch. So that packages fetched from the nodejs repository will be installed properly.

A few more details/reasoning:
In some very rare circumstances, a non-existing /sbin/init seems to cause an nvm install to fail without any 'good' hint as to why it fails. (It seems like the commit 7f2ccd5 made it especially hard to pinpoint what's going on here, because even if things silently fail there, it might still cause a script failure in those circumstances.
This could look like this, for example:
Downloading and installing node v14.18.1...
Binary download failed, trying source.

‚Ä¶and then nothing more.
I am not entirely certain what exactly causes it to fail here ‚Äì I'd (very broadly) assume that some ""globally"" set shell option from whatever called nvm might still cause the ls error to cause the nvm script to exit. I've originally come across it on Arch in makechrootpkg, although the main culprit seems to be in makepkg itself ‚Äì which seems to be enough to reproduce it.
Basically, it happens when running makepkg for a PKGBUILD where nvm is used (as, for example, recommended at https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Node.js_package_guidelines#Using_nvm), when /sbin/init does not exist (on Arch it does not exist by default, but is provided by the systemd-sysvcompat package).
I've only come across it by accident by building in a ""clean chroot"" (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/DeveloperWiki:Building_in_a_clean_chroot), where a package providing /sbin/init is not installed by default. The chroot environment itself does not seem to be relevant though (directly using nvm in it is possible) ‚Äì it seems like it's only the makepkg environment that seems to matter.
On top of that, this ""had worked a few weeks ago"" ‚Äì but I was not able to find out what had changed on Arch's end that might have caused this.
I understand this is probably not really an nvm issue ‚Äì I had just hoped that, with this being an easy fix (without any obvious downsides ‚Äì to me at least), which shouldn't do much damage but just handles the non-existing file ""a bit more cleanly"", it might be easiest to address this here. Unless I can find out where things are actually causing the issue in Arch's tools.",3,2

This is to workaround the use of the -J and --strip-components options, which OpenBSD's tar does not support. If the xz format archive was downloaded, it correctly calls xzcat and pipes the output to tar. If not, it correctly calls the tar with the normal compression flag. In either case, it does not append the --strip-components=1 option, but rather uses the -s option to perform ed(1)-style basic regex replacement on the path.
This is tested to execute correctly on OpenBSD 7.0 (current release as of this PR). It does not address compilation issues of the downloaded node source code, as mentioned in #2134, which will likely require upstreaming of some subset of the OpenBSD-specific source patches that were developed for the OpenBSD ports build of node (see the OpenBSD patches for node-12.22.7 here or the implementation of binary builds for OpenBSD, but it does allow you to reach that step without error.

Latest node, v18.10.0, fails at npm install on xenial, breaking builder.

Resolved by running nvm install --lts before nvm install 16, this sets the default node version correctly for the tests and uses 16 for npm install.  This is a workaround which won't be required after migrating from Travis CI to GitHub Actions, where more control over the tests to distro orchestration is possible.


Some old versions of node won't install on versions of ubuntu newer than xenial, breaking tests. Example: 0.6.21

I wasn't sure what would be the best solution. Right now, if NVM_ARCH is armv8l, it falls back to armv7l since ARMv8 is backward compatible with ARMv7.
I think other approaches are

Changing aarch64) NVM_ARCH=""arm64"" ;; pattern to  aarch64 | armv8l) NVM_ARCH=""arm64"" ;;. That way it would step into the following code block and also fall back to armv7l.

  # If running a 64bit ARM kernel but a 32bit ARM userland,
  # change ARCH to 32bit ARM (armv7l) if /sbin/init is 32bit executable
  if [ ""$(uname)"" = ""Linux"" ] \
    && ( [ ""${NVM_ARCH}"" = arm64 ] || [ ""${NVM_ARCH}"" = armv8l ] ) \
    && [ ""$(command od -An -t x1 -j 4 -N 1 ""/sbin/init"" 2>/dev/null)"" = ' 01' ]\
  ; then
    NVM_ARCH=armv7l
    HOST_ARCH=armv7l

Instead of falling back to armv7l, create another if block to use arm64, something like

  if [ ""$(uname)"" = ""Linux"" ] \
    && [ ""${NVM_ARCH}"" = armv8l ] \
  ; then
    NVM_ARCH=arm64

nvm alias default node
While this command might work in some cases (as node will point to the latest version installed on your system), it might not behave as intended if you want to default to a specific version of Node.js.
This command is actually referring to the Set default node version section in the nvm's README. It's crucial to note that the instructions suggest setting a specific node version of your choosing, rather than using the generic node.
So if you're aiming to set a particular version (for example, 14.15.1) as your default, the correct command would be:
nvm alias default 14.15.1
This ensures that the specified version of Node.js will be used by default. If you simply use node as in the first command, it could point to any installed version, which might not be what you intend.",3,3
