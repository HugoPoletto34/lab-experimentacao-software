I thought of maybe adding this article as well -
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/01/eliminating-known-security-vulnerabilities-with-snyk/
And maybe this quote -

Running untrusted code inside your system poses a broad security risk. Tackling it isn’t simple, but a good place to start is by addressing known vulnerabilities. These are publicly disclosed security bugs, typically found and logged by users, or intentionally found and reported by security researchers. Being public makes these issues the easiest ones for attackers to find and exploit, and so very important to address.


Right now, roughly 14% of the top npm packages carry known vulnerabilities. The stats are far worse for full applications: over 80% of Snyk users find vulnerabilities when testing their applications.

The only issue with it it's seem like a promotional peace for snyk and was written by one of their co-founders",3,4

Even if you're not in a microservice environment, being able to view system health at a glance can be a tremendous relief.
I work in a company with a fleet of 100+ services across thousands of instances. We have developed a schema that all our services have to adhere to. Part of it is to expose a healthcheck endpoint that tells you the overall health of the system, as well as information about each individual check - including dependencies. This allows us to create a graph of connected services so that if there's an outage in one system, we can see which other systems will be affected by it. It can also help us discover bottlenecks where one system may affect many others, in which case we should strive to provide fallback behaviors that allow us to at least partially function.
For the record, I'm the developer of express-physical, which I linked to in the ""read more"" section. We use that library across all of our node services, and it has worked well for us so far.",3,5

So I created an svg template with a clip path that you can load up in most tools that support svg and export with transparency.
I also added SVGs for the icons used in committee section, since those also look kind of funky in in other themes.
While messing with things I discovered that adding min-width to the contributor template somehow still affects the profile images even though it gets sanitized away, so I added that so that there's a lot less shifting of the contributors table.
I probably need to revert it, but I was curious if there's any reason the README's for the other languages aren't included in the automated contributors updates?",4,4
