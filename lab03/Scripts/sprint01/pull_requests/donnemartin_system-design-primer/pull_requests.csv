About native there is a shake of the notation of ""ネーティブ"" and ""ネイティブ"" in README-ja.
I think that it is probably typo. 🤔

original contents:

$ grep -ir ""native"" ./README.md 
./README.md:RPC is focused on exposing behaviors.  RPCs are often used for performance reasons with internal communications, as you can hand-craft native calls to better fit your use cases.
./README.md:Choose a native library (aka SDK) when:

./README-ja.md:RPCは振る舞いを公開することに焦点を当てています。RPCは内部通信パフォーマンスを理由として使われることが多いです。というのも、使用する状況に合わせてネーティブコールを自作することができるからです。

There are still some that feel that there are benifits of using the 'well-known' terminology of master and slave far rather than those without negative historic connotations such as leader/follower or primary/replica citing readability etc..
However, I hope you will atleast consider seriously altering the language in this repository, especially if it's helpful as a tool for interviews to work on large-scale systems given many companies have adopted either leader/follower or primary/replica, as alternate terms of reference.
Some examples its alteration, and conversation around it can be found below. I have tried to find some who haven't made the move in order to provide a balanced argument, feel free to add more in the comments:
