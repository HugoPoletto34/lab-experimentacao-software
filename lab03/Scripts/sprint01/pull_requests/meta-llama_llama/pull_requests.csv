In the current state Meta published the whole replication recipe open-source (GPL v3) but asks other entities to spend a lot of energy (potentially releasing massive amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere) to replicate and release a truly open-source version of LLaMA. Given the fact that LLaMA model weights are currently already available for download at many different places this is from an ecological perspective a preposterous management decision and in my personal opinion not well aligned with the overall ecological ambitions of Meta.
If you say ""open"" (as in the LLaMA paper) and you want to get the bonus credibility that comes with it .. please do it fully and not half-hearted as done currently.",477,250

Accept the PRESIGNED_URL as parameter, so the user don't have to edit the file and add it.
Accept MODEL_SIZE and TARGET_FOLDER as environments variables, with default values.
Added the parameter --no-check-certificate for cases behind proxies.
Check downloaded files integrity before download it again, so it'll download only the corrupted or the missing ones.

Now we can call like those options:


With parameters (URL_FROM_EMAIL in quotes is mandatory)
MODEL_SIZE=""7B,13B,30B,65B"" TARGET_FOLDER=""model-weights"" ./download.sh ""URL_FROM_EMAIL""


Basic form (it'll use previous values as default, URL_FROM_EMAIL in quotes is mandatory) skipping TLS
