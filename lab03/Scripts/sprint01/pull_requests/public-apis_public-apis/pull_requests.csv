Once merged in, you'd have to change the settings to build from the /docs folder.

This is great for removing dead links over time, but can cause a real headache for users who open a pull request only to see their changes ""break"" the build, when 99.9% of the time it is someone else's link that is causing the failure.
Therefore, in the spirit of alleviating this headache, I have written a simple format validator that will run on pull requests. This validation checks for valid auth values, markdown link syntax, and a few other goodies.
I plan to add more checks to this soon, but my plan is to merge in the CI changes quickly to stop having pull requests fail for no good reason - and to give maintainers a break from having to point out simple fixes :)",2,1

Hola!
Somos un grupo de estudiantes de la Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM) y estamos
haciendo una campaña de concienciación sobre el uso de licencias.
Razones por las que usar una licencia:

Es FÁCIL de usar: escoge la licencia, copia el texto genérico y listo! Ya puedes usarla en tus proyectos. En el siguiente link puedes encontrar más información:
LIMITAS qué usos pueden tener las personas para usar tu contenido, de esta manera evitas problemas de copias y plagios
Compartir es poder! Las licencias libres te dan credito en todo momento permitiendo que otros usen tu trabajo bajo TUS condiciones.
En el siguiente video se explican los tipos de licencias para que puedas escoger una que se adapte a tus necesidades

Hemos elegido la licencia MIT para este pull request. En este link puedes encontrar mas informacion sobre esta licencia
Gracias por tu atención! Esperamos que te haya servido de ayuda
