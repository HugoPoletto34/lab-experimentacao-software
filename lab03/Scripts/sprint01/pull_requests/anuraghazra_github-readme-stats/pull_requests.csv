Exponential distribution's support is [0; inf) which means if we will calculate survival function (same as 1 - cdf (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_function#Definition)) then for all zeros we will get a person with a score equal to a 100 which makes a lot of sense. Also in practice exponential distribution is quite accurate showing activity of a person. See example below:
This is the real activity distribution histogram (taken from https://movespring.com/blog/how-to-set-a-goal-for-your-next-activity-or-step-challenge-5f74c65ac49982000764facf):

This is the exponential distribution histogram with different parameters:

Here is one more example with real distribution (as blue) and fitted exponential distribution (as red):

Next step is to restore parameters of exponential distribution for real distribution. In my opinion Method of Moments (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_moments_(statistics)) is the easiest to understand and comes from a single property we would like to have: expectation over our parameterized distribution would be equal to expectation of the real distribution. (see *_VALUE variables in code). As expectation of exponential distribution with parameter \lambda is equal to 1 / \lambda then if we have an expectation (which is equal to an average over users) of real distribution then the restored \lambda = 1 / expectation.
Now we have 7 distributions over different aspects of Github Profile: Commits, Contributions, Issues, PRs, Stars, Followers, Repositories. We can understand how ""good"" a Github Profile in each aspect by calculating survival function over each of these 7 distributions in the points corresponding to Github Profile stats (the lesser value the better). To get a single number from 7 numbers we can have for example an average of these numbers but that wouldn't be good as a person who is great in one aspect and bad in others (e.g. Linus Torvalds with only 2 repositories and low stats in PRs and Issues and a ton of stars and followers) will never get an S+ rank so we need to have an aggregate functions which would stimulate low values at least in one aspect. One of such functions is min(...) over 7 aspects but this doesn't encourage you to develop any aspects except the only one you are best in, so we will use harmonic average (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean) which fits our needs (as it almost equal to min(...) for values much less than 1 and also has a non-zero gradient over each variable).
As you can see from tests:

A decent user (400 stars and 100 followers) has an A++ rank
Newly created account has lowest possible score = 100
Linus Torvalds has highest possible score = 0 (this wasn't intended I just realized it when ran a script)


IMPORTANT NOTICE
Current values are not set to be equal to 1 / <average stat over users> as I couldn't find any official (and even unofficial) statistics referring to these. So they are just set to what I see as an average Github User.",11,27

As #883, #455 and #1029, I've noticed that the function calculateRank doesn't work as expected.
The first problem is the use of a normal distribution instead of an exponential distribution, as pointed out by #960 . The second is that each metric has the same weight in the score, while some are clearly better indicators (e.g. stars). I've corrected both problems in this PR.
If you want to try it out before merging, I've hosted this version on Vercel.




Importantly, in #960, being extremely good in a single metric (e.g. 100k commits) while being terrible elsewhere still gets an ""S+"" rank. In my implementation, in order to get ""S+"", you need to be outstanding everywhere. However, you can still get ""A+"" or ""S"" if a single metric is poor (e.g. contributions or issues) but you have a lot of stars and followers.",17,93

Advantages of using Github Colors:

Github Colors are generally more populated and almost always updated faster than Wakatime colors
Updating the colors doesn't require anymore than running the script file (instead of relying on PRs to edit the json file) [unless Github decides to change the format of the yaml file, which is very unlikely]
Unified color system with other types of cards (no color conflicts)
This is ultimately a project to display development stats on github so I think it makes sense for it to show Github language colors

If anything needs to be changed, please tell me and I'll do so
New Dependencies:

js-yaml

Since the original file is in yaml format we need something to parse it into a regular JS object and then write it down in JSON format
This is set to be a development dependency, as it's only used in a development script



Other Dependencies:

axios (already a dependency of the project)
