GitHub: https://github.com/opticdev/optic
Website: https://www.useoptic.com
Optic automatically documents changes, tests every endpoint, and gives you valuable insight into how your APIs are being used.
Features:
📝 Accurate API Documentation - We built Optic to make maintaining accurate specs for your APIs automatic and developer friendly. Once you add Optic to your API repo, it automatically tracks your API’s behavior and maintains a change log of its behavior over time.
It’s kind of like Git, but instead of tracking files, Optic automatically diffs and tracks API endpoints. When new behavior is observed, Optic makes it easy to update the spec.
⚙️ Automated Testing - Automate most of your contract testing. Optic uses live testing with spec coverage to make testing APIs easy.
👍 Beautiful Docs - Stripe-style documentation for every API managed by Optic.

pure-http is a simple web framework for Node.js with zero dependencies and low latency. That helps you use the middleware and router in native HTTP.
Usage
Basic server:
const pureHttp = require('pure-http');

const app = pureHttp();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello world');
});

app.listen(3000);
Exist server:
const http = require('http');
const pureHttp = require('pure-http');

const server = http.createServer();

const app = pureHttp({ server });

app.listen(3000);
Secure server:
const https = require('https');
const pureHttp = require('pure-http');

const server = https.createServer({
  key: ...,
  cert: ...,
});

const app = pureHttp({ server });

app.listen(3000);
Router
const { Router } = require('pure-http');

const router = Router();

router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello world');
});

/* ... */

const pureHttp = require('pure-http');

const app = pureHttp();

app.use('/api', router);

app.listen(3000);",3,1
