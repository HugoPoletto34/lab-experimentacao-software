I am Saurabh, co-founder of Hackr.io. Hackr.io is a programming community & a great place to find the best online programming courses and tutorials. It's a one stop solution for tutorial recommendations with 5000+ tutorial of more than 140 programming languages.
I was looking at your learning resources page and found it pretty useful. I believe that Hackr.io would be really useful to the developer community in finding the right programming course/tutorial and would make a nice addition to your resource page.
Hackr is also listed on other esteemed websites like Lehigh University's resource page and official Official Python wiki page to name a few.
Thanks for the list of great resources you have compiled. Enjoy your week:)",2,0

Split it to a few components sections.
I started it with animation components and united all of them into the new animation components section.
Advantages:

Less conflicts. The more splitted the readme. the less chances two different people will change the same line. Because they usually put it in the end of every category.
Easier to read. Cleaner and tidier. The components section is too big to actually go through it and to be useful..

Also, I want to suggest the library ""react-singular-component"", it's not a very popular one, but it is great in my opinion. It gives you a way to easily create a transition between two dom elements of a component.
Useful when:

You have the same component in a few places of your website, but not at the same time. And when one is gone you want it to go smoothly to the other dom.

This gif demonstrates what it looks like:

This react component is efficient and customable, and already tried and works on a few products I made.",2,4
