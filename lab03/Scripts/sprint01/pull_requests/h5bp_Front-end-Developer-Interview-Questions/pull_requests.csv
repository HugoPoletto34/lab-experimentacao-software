And this article Responsive vs Adaptive Design – Which is Best for Mobile Viewing of Your Website? only strengthens the position that there is now real difference between the two when it comes to coding a solution. Sure, there may be a design strategy here, but this is not a list of questions for designers.
The replacement question gets to the core of the question about an actual implementation strategy for development.
The expected answer from the question would be the expectation that the interviewee would understand that there is a significant different between coding a UI from a desktop-first perspective versus a mobile-first one. Also, this person would expect to understand the difference between min-width versus max-width in these scenarios.",2,1

What are some advantages for using the new arrow => function syntax?
This question will determine a developer's understanding of the new function syntax. An interviewer would expect to hear answers like; reduced verbosity for creating anonymous functions and lexical scoping.
What advantage does using the arrow syntax for a method in a constructor offer?
This question is more focused at determining a developer's understanding of lexical scoping.
What is the definition of a higher-order function?
Evaluating the general knowledge of a developer's understanding of higher-order functions. An interviewer would expect an answer along the lines of;

a function that takes a function as an argument, or
a function that returns a function

An interviewer may also ask the developer to illustrate an example of a higher-order function. For example:
// a function that accepts a function as an argument
eventTrigger.addEventListener('click', consoleClick);
// a function that returns a function 
function character(string) {
  const concatString = `I am ${string}`;
  const punc = '!';

  return function() {
    console.log(concatString + punc);
  }
}

const groot = character('Groot');
groot(); // ""I am Groot!""
Can you give an example for destructuring an object or an array?
This question is to determine a developer's understanding of this new syntax. Examples should resemble the following:
// destructuring an array
const listing1040Willow = ['remodeled kitchen', '4 bedrooms', '2.5 baths'];
const [feature, bedrooms, baths] = listing1040Willow;
// destructuring an object
const purchases = {
  purchaseOnline: {
    one: 'http://www.amazon.com',
    two: 'http://www.bestbuy.com',
    three: 'http://www.costco.com'
  }
}

const {one, two, three} = purchases.purchaseOnline;
A developer illustrating code more advanced then these examples, or using a combination/shorthand syntax for complex objects would be considered a senior developer IMHO.
ES6 Template Literals offer a lot of flexibility in generating strings, can you give an example?
Everyone should know about using the back-tick ${} syntax. A developer offering up additional uses, for example a block of HTML as used with frameworks like React would show an advanced understanding of this new syntax.
Can you give an example of a curry function and why this syntax offers an advantage?
A common understanding of a curry function would be the following:
function foo(a) {
  return function(b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}
Advantages would a developer's ability to breakdown complex functions and allow for nested functions to be returned as a function and be assigned to other variables.",3,0

One question was removed as it is a duplicate question in relation to media queries.
The new question is added to inquire as to a person's knowledge of the two very different code styles when writing CSS.
Can you explain the differences between Functional CSS and Component CSS development styles? What are some advantages/disadvantages of either style?

An interviewer would expect answers to illustrate the differences between these coding styles and possible naming conventions. Advantages/disadvantages are opinions for the most part and would allow the interviewer to gain perspective as to the developer's personal insights on the subject.

Changelog
Sourced from markdown-it's changelog.

[13.0.0] - 2022-04-22
Added

Added a new token type text_special to store escaped characters, same as text but
unaffected by replacement plugins (smartquotes, typographer, linkifier, etc.).
Added a new rule text_join in core ruler. Text replacement plugins may choose to
insert themselves before it.

Changed

(p) is no longer replaced with § by typographer (conflicts with ℗), #763.
text_collapse rule is renamed to fragments_join.

Fixed

Smartquotes, typographic replacements and plain text links can now be escaped
with backslash (e.g. \(c) or google\.com are no longer replaced).
Fixed collision of emphasis and linkifier (so http://example.org/foo._bar_-_baz
is now a single link, not emphasized). Emails and fuzzy links are not affected by this.

Bug Fixes

add extension in the package.json main entry (#608) (3ad0567)
do not reset the ping timer after upgrade (1f5d469), closes socketio/socket.io-client-swift#1309

Features

decrease the default value of maxHttpBufferSize (58e274c)

This change reduces the default value from 100 mb to a more sane 1 mb.
This helps protect the server against denial of service attacks by malicious clients sending huge amounts of data.

What are primitive and non-primitive data types?
Which of these two are passed by reference in a function?

Knowledge of primitive and non-primitive data types are really essential for writing error free code especially surrounding deep copy and shallow copy inside a function
Deep understanding of these tests experience dealing with objects/array inside a function passed as a parameter
