Key Changes

The load_documents() function now uses Python's multiprocessing module, allowing for concurrent document loading across multiple CPU cores.
This modification takes advantage of machines with multiple cores and/or hyper-threading capabilities, leading to significant potential improvements in document loading times.
It enhances performance, especially when dealing with a large number of documents.

This update is expected to significantly speed up the document loading process, contributing to overall system efficiency and user experience. Please review and provide your feedback.

Apparently, the from_documents implementation used in privateGPT was a convenience to connect the output of text_splitters (Documents) which contain both the text and metadata to Chroma from_texts which expects two lists, one with strings and one with dicts (metadata). The code used in the old implementation of from_documents to split the Document list into two list is inserted into ingest.py (main) to allow use of the from_texts method.

Keep the same interface for ingest.py and privateGPT.py but refactored to use a library and a CLI.
I've built this, to speed up my own usage and to prepare for building a specific client. Sharing with the community thinking it will be useful for you too.
With this PR, privateGPT.py becomes a Click-based CLI exposing the following commands:

chat, the default command when the CLI is invoked without command that runs the original privateGPT scripts
ingest, executes the logic for ingesting documents
init, this is new and it's useful to bootstrap a new env, copying the default configuration and downloading the default model
reset, just drop the database (instead of dropping manually the folder)`

Note that the mentioned libraries, LocalAI and vLLM, also have their own providers in LlamaIndex. This is a more generic solution that should support those and many more libraries.
One fun implication that I'm testing is the possibility of running PrivateGPT on top of another instance of PrivateGPT. The top-level instance manages embeddings, and the bottom-level instance runs an LLM. With a little additional logic, it could be possible to route requests from the parent instance to multiple child instances based on model id in the request, effectively letting a single PrivateGPT instance serve multiple models while benefiting from a single document store.

It follows the breaking changed introduced by LlamaIndex 0.10.x
Changes:

Documentation update
More and better setups examples in installation documentation, followed by a reviewed set of default settings-.yaml
Stop using ServiceContext (deprecated in LlamaIndex)
Refactor of all imports following changes in LlamaIndex - we went through the full migration, no ""deprecated"" or ""legacy"" API is being used.
Cleanup of dependencies, making most of the dependencies optional. Follow LlamaIndex nomenclature to name the optional dependencies for full clarity.
Stopped using the concept ""local"" that used to abstract the usage of LlamaCPP LLM + Huggingface Embeddings. Now both concepts are separated for clarity and extensibility.

The new way of installing privateGPT's dependencies is by choosing the different modules to use and installing them through ""extras"":
poetry install --extras ""<extra1> <extra2>...""
Where <extra> can be any of the following:

ui: adds support for UI using Gradio
llms-ollama: adds support for Ollama LLM, the easiest way to get a local LLM running
llms-llama-cpp: adds support for local LLM using LlamaCPP - expect a messy installation process on some platforms
llms-sagemaker: adds support for Amazon Sagemaker LLM, requires Sagemaker inference endpoints
llms-openai: adds support for OpenAI LLM, requires OpenAI API key
llms-openai-like: adds support for 3rd party LLM providers that are compatible with OpenAI's API
embeddings-huggingface: adds support for local Embeddings using HuggingFace
embeddings-sagemaker: adds support for Amazon Sagemaker Embeddings, requires Sagemaker inference endpoints
embeddings-openai = adds support for OpenAI Embeddings, requires OpenAI API key
vector-stores-qdrant: adds support for Qdrant vector store
vector-stores-chroma: adds support for Chroma DB vector store
vector-stores-postgres: adds support for Postgres vector store

We are making Ollama setup the recommended local setup:

In the parallel ingest design, the blocking mutex for the index write causes a bottleneck stalling the embedding computations until the write operation completes. This is particularly problematic because the index is updated per file, exacerbating the slowdown. In contrast, the pipeline design adopts a non-blocking approach. Here, all worker data is fed into a single queue, where it accumulates before being written less frequently. This design choice allows for smoother and more efficient processing, as it minimizes the impact of filesystem operations on the overall workflow.

#1715 was the original.
In the settings.yaml file I added two new settings.  Both of these are important to use together IMO.

  similarity_top_k: 2
  #This value controls how many ""top"" documents the RAG returns to use in the context.
  #similarity_value: 0.45
  #This value is disabled by default.  If you enable this settings, the RAG will only use articles that meet a certain percentage score.

similarity_top_k controls how many of the ""top"" results are returned by the RAG Pipeline.  Since i am ingesting lots of information for our organization from many different areas, sometimes I might have 5, 6 or 7 relevant sources.
However the risk of increasing this value, is that you get a lot of junk that does not relate other than having a key word or something.  So similarity_value comes into play here and is used in the chat_service.py file.
This scare requires the RAG to match a certain level of the document, or it is thrown out.  In my test cases 0.40 works well to weed out some of the lower end junk that comes out when you increase similarity_top_k to a higher value.",2,0

We've got a butter smooth production setup as of right now by doing the following things:


Run the embedding on a separate Ollama instance (docker container)
By doing this we avoid waiting times needed where Ollama swaps the LLM in (V)RAM to the embedding model in VRAM and back


By explicitely stating with each request we want the used model to stay in (V)RAM for another 6 hours
By default Ollama makes a model leave (V)RAM after 5 minutes of not being used. This caused long wait times to reload the LLM after > 5 minutes (running a 20 GB quant at the moment)

This PR introduces support for document reranking, specifically leveraging SentenceTransformer cross-encoders. The addition aims to provide a lightweight and optimized approach to reranking, enhancing the model's response quality and speed.
Motivation
The integration of a reranking feature addresses the need for more relevant and accurate responses by pre-filtering documents before answer generation. The choice of SentenceTransformer's cross-encoder as the reranker is motivated by its efficiency and effectiveness in identifying the most relevant documents, compared to traditional LLM-based reranking methods.
Changes Made

Added an optional SentenceTransformerRerank node_postprocessor to ChatService, which facilitates the reranking process using the SentenceTransformer cross-encoder.
Updated settings to include rerank-specific configurations, allowing users to enable and customize reranking according to their specific needs. This includes parameters such as model and top_n, where the latter controls the selection process of documents for final response generation.
Documentation updates to guide users through enabling reranking, installing necessary dependencies (poetry install --extras rerank-sentence-transformers), and configuring rerank settings effectively for optimal performance.

The reranking feature is disabled by default to accommodate the additional dependencies and the need for users to adjust configurations based on their unique use cases.
Future Considerations
Looking ahead, there's potential to further refine the reranking functionality by:

Creating a dedicated reranker component: This would facilitate the incorporation of different reranker types, enhancing flexibility and customization for users.
Expanding reranker support: Exploring and integrating additional reranker methods beyond the SentenceTransformer cross-encoder could provide users with more options to tailor the reranking process to their specific requirements.",4,0
