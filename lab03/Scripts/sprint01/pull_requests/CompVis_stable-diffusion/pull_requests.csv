Hopefully this will avoid a bunch of questions from people asking ""how do I make it different each time without generating my own random seed?""",2,0

To get this to work, the only thing that needs to be done differently is that the conda environment needs to use environment-mac.yaml instead of environment.yaml. That is because the cudatoolkit dependency in environment.yaml generates an error. I also believe (but haven't verified) that torch and torchvision need to be updated, so I updated them.",6,4
