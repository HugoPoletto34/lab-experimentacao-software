While performing unit test cases there was race condition between two threads, so it was not guaranteed to work every time. Used an interface DelayProvider for simulating delay, and while unit testing fake delay provider is used that eradicates the use of Threads in unit test cases, which is not a good practice.
This issue could also have been resolved by increasing the Thread.sleep(50) interval to higher value, but being design patterns repository I opted for better approach of not using threads when unit testing, due to complication of unit testing.

Root Cause
Test cases failed due to presence of global state in CallsCount. Because AppTest was executed before B2BServiceTest, it scheduled 1 sec timer using ThrottleTimerImpl class. While resetting it used that global CallCount.reset() method, which reset all counters. So that causes thread safety issue because of unintended sharing of application state between test cases, which is not a good practice.
Solution
Solution was not to have global state using static map. Rather global state should be maintained using single object and passing that as dependency wherever needed.

Checkstyle didn't like that one either and wanted the package name to be ""separated from the previous statement"" by a blank line, so I ended up creating a custom license header with this blank line added (license-plugin-header-style.xml).

With the implementation
public Sheep clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
  return new Sheep(name);
}

it would not be possible (in general) to override clone() in a subclass (e.g. SpecialSheep), because invoking super.clone would return an object of the wrong type, and if we create a new instance of SpecialSheep it is not always possible to copy over the private fields.
This problem can be fixed by using the mechanism provided by Object.clone, i.e. by invoking super.clone(). This creates a shallow copy (which is just fine in this example as the type of the name field (String) is immutable.",2,4

public X clone() { return new X(this); }

In addition, every class (also the abstract base classes) must provide a copy constructor. I have added such constructors to the abstract base classes (which would allow to evolve these classes, i.e. to add private fields later on). These copy constructors are called form the sub classes.
The Cloneable interface does not need to be implemented, this interface is only needed when Java-Cloning is used, and the CloneNotSupportedException can also be dropped, as it is also only used in the context of Java Cloning (i.e. the mechanism provided by Object.clone, which is not used in this implmentation).
As a consequence of the removal of the CloneNotSupportedException I also had to remove the test HeroFactoryImplTest.java as this test checked this behavior. Actually the test was strange as it invoked clone on abstract classes which never can have instances.
I also decided to change the abstract class Prototype into an Interface.
The contract of cloning states, that the returned object must be a new reference, but it must be equal to the origin. I added equals-implementations to all classes and added a line in the test to check whether the original and its copy are equal.",2,1

Updates jackson-databind from 2.8.5 to 2.10.2 This update includes security fixes.

Vulnerabilities fixed
Sourced from The GitHub Security Advisory Database.

Low severity vulnerability that affects com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind
FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.9.1 might allow attackers to have a variety of impacts by leveraging failure to block the logback-core class from polymorphic deserialization. Depending on the classpath content, remote code execution may be possible.
Affected versions: < 2.9.9.1

Sourced from The GitHub Security Advisory Database.

Moderate severity vulnerability that affects com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind
SubTypeValidator.java in FasterXML jackson-databind before 2.9.9.2 mishandles default typing when ehcache is used, leading to remote code execution.
Affected versions: < 2.9.9.2

Sourced from The GitHub Security Advisory Database.

Moderate severity vulnerability that affects com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind
A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.9.2. This occurs when Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a specific property) for an externally exposed JSON endpoint and the service has the logback jar in the classpath.
Affected versions: < 2.9.9.2

Sourced from The GitHub Security Advisory Database.

High severity vulnerability that affects com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind
FasterXML jackson-databind through 2.8.10 and 2.9.x through 2.9.3 allows unauthenticated remote code execution because of an incomplete fix for the CVE-2017-7525 deserialization flaw. This is exploitable by sending maliciously crafted JSON input to the readValue method of the ObjectMapper, bypassing a blacklist that is ineffective if the Spring libraries are available in the classpath.
Affected versions: < 2.8.11

Sourced from The GitHub Security Advisory Database.

High severity vulnerability that affects com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind
A deserialization flaw was discovered in the jackson-databind in versions before 2.8.10 and 2.9.1, which could allow an unauthenticated user to perform code execution by sending the maliciously crafted input to the readValue method of the ObjectMapper. This issue extends the previous flaw CVE-2017-7525 by blacklisting more classes that could be used maliciously.
Affected versions: < 2.8.11

Sourced from The GitHub Security Advisory Database.

High severity vulnerability that affects com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind
FasterXML jackson-databind before 2.8.11.1 and 2.9.x before 2.9.5 allows unauthenticated remote code execution because of an incomplete fix for the CVE-2017-7525 deserialization flaw. This is exploitable by sending maliciously crafted JSON input to the readValue method of the ObjectMapper, bypassing a blacklist that is ineffective if the c3p0 libraries are available in the classpath.
Affected versions: < 2.8.11.1

Sourced from The GitHub Security Advisory Database.

Critical severity vulnerability that affects com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind
A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind before 2.9.10. It is related to com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariConfig.
Affected versions: < 2.9.10

Sourced from The GitHub Security Advisory Database.

Critical severity vulnerability that affects com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind
A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind before 2.9.10. It is related to com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource. This is a different vulnerability than CVE-2019-14540.
Affected versions: < 2.9.10

Sourced from The GitHub Security Advisory Database.

Moderate severity vulnerability that affects com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind
A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind 2.0.0 through 2.9.10. When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a specific property) for an externally exposed JSON endpoint and the service has the commons-dbcp (1.4) jar in the classpath, and an attacker can find an RMI service endpoint to access, it is possible to make the service execute a malicious payload. This issue exists because of org.apache.commons.dbcp.datasources.SharedPoolDataSource and org.apache.commons.dbcp.datasources.PerUserPoolDataSource mishandling.
Affected versions: < 2.9.10.1

Sourced from The GitHub Security Advisory Database.

Critical severity vulnerability that affects com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind
A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind 2.0.0 through 2.9.10. When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a specific property) for an externally exposed JSON endpoint and the service has the apache-log4j-extra (version 1.2.x) jar in the classpath, and an attacker can provide a JNDI service to access, it is possible to make the service execute a malicious payload.
Affected versions: < 2.9.10.1

Sourced from The GitHub Security Advisory Database.

Update: Want to take over the Java ecosystem? All you need is a MITM!


This is a security fix for a  vulnerability in your Apache Maven pom.xml file(s).
The build files indicate that this project is resolving dependencies over HTTP instead of HTTPS.
This leaves your build vulnerable to allowing a Man in the Middle (MITM) attackers to execute arbitrary code on your or your computer or CI/CD system.
This vulnerability has a CVSS v3.0 Base Score of 8.1/10.
POC code has existed since 2014 to maliciously compromise a JAR file in-flight.
MITM attacks against HTTP are increasingly common, for example Comcast is known to have done it to their own users.
This contribution is a part of a submission to the GitHub Security Lab Bug Bounty program.

Mainly I've extracted parts of the original methods into their own methods to solve readability issues.

In the traditional way, we usually have a Command interface and the concrete commands implement this interface

We know that if any interface just has one abstract method then it can be used a functional interface and can be passed around as lambda expression instead of instantiating it.

If the transaction is successful, the default receipt will be showed.
If the transaction is failed, the particular receipt of one of the special cases will be showed, instead of just a null object with no meaning.
