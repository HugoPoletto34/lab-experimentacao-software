The primary goal of this is to incorporate a series of vulnerability fixes (minimatch, hoek, and lodash) that were introduced within the dependencies of gulp, and as a result were patched starting in Gulp v4.
The basic upgrade flow works like this:

Upgrade Gulp from 3.9.1 to 4.0.0
Upgrade gulp-help to the version that specifically supports Gulp4 (1.6.1 to chmontgomery/gulp-help#gulp4)
Upgrade additional dependencies that fix additional audit issues (gulp-concat-css, gulp-copy, gulp-less, gulp-watch, and github)
Remove run-sequence which is now deprecated and natively replaced with gulp.series
Fix calc() errors that arose out of interpolated strings with the latest version of gulp-less

With those tasks complete, npm install works and completes as intended with no errors and 0 security vulnerabilities.",8,30
