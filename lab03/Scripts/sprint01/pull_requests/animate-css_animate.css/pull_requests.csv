The documentation spoke about custom builds to reduce size and showed a way to customize them:
""attention_seekers"": { ""bounce"": true, ""flash"": false, ""pulse"": false, ""shake"": true, ""headShake"": true, ""swing"": true, ""tada"": true, ""wobble"": true, ""jello"":true }
However that never worked for me if I wanted to add only one animation, the whole group of animations was always gone independently of the boolean value, that's how I found out it was a bug.
I corrected the gulpfile to iterate objects instead of the for loop for arrays, and corrected animate-config.json to fit the way is expected to work by the documentation.
With the current fix I am finally able to use just the ""shake"" animation with only 624B instead of the 17Kb of the original file üòÑ",2,3

Abortion is a form of healthcare, and as such is a fundamental human right. By introducing this legislation, lawmakers in Texas are removing the bodily autonomy of women and endangering their well-being by forcing them to seek potentially unsafe alternatives.
Amnesty International states:

Access to safe abortion services is a human right. Under international human rights law, everyone has a right to life, a right to health, and a right to be free from violence, discrimination, and torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.

Removal of access to abortion is one thing, but rewarding bounties for disclosure of information about women seeking abortions puts them in immense physical danger and is itself a violation of their human rights.
Not only this, but these legal changes are unconstitutional and the changes themselves violate international UN Human Rights laws.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) Article 21, Section 3 states:

The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government

More than 60% of Americans believe people should be able to obtain abortions in the first trimester of pregnancy (source), and the current presidential administration have themselves stated that abortion rights are ‚Äúnon-negotiable‚Äù.
I want to make it clear to the Animate.css community and the people who use Animate.css for their work and projects that we take a firm stance in support of women‚Äôs bodily autonomy and other forms of human rights, and do not permit the use of Animate.css on any project that impedes on these rights. To this end, I plan to update Animate.css‚Äôs license to the Hippocratic License, a variation of the currently-used MIT licence which also bans the use of licensed software in projects that violate human rights.",5,3
