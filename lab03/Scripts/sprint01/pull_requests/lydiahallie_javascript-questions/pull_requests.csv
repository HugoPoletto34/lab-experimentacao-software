There is a ReferenceError thrown in the code after trying to get a property of a non declared variable here. While the answer B is alright the explanation seems to forget to mention the fact that the error is thrown.
119. What's the output?
const person = {
  firstName: 'Lydia',
  lastName: 'Hallie',
  pet: {
    name: 'Mara',
    breed: 'Dutch Tulip Hound',
  },
  getFullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  },
};

console.log(person.pet?.name);
console.log(person.pet?.family?.name);
console.log(person.getFullName?.());
console.log(member.getLastName?.());

A: undefined undefined undefined undefined
B: Mara undefined Lydia Hallie ReferenceError
C: Mara null Lydia Hallie null
D: null ReferenceError null ReferenceError

Answer

Answer: B
With the optional chaining operator ?., we no longer have to explicitly check whether the deeper nested values are valid or not. If we're trying to access a property on an undefined or null value (nullish), the expression short-circuits and returns undefined.
person.pet?.name: person has a property named pet: person.pet is not nullish. It has a property called name, and returns Mara.
person.pet?.family?.name: person has a property named pet: person.pet is not nullish. pet does not have a property called family, person.pet.family is nullish. The expression returns undefined.
person.getFullName?.(): person has a property named getFullName: person.getFullName() is not nullish and can get invoked, which returns Lydia Hallie.
member.getLastName?.(): member is not defined: member.getLastName() is nullish. The expression returns undefined.  variable member is non existent therefore a ReferenceError gets thrown!",4,2

In case we tried to ""return"" an object with just one property - the key would be interpreted as a label, the code would have been valid and indeed undefined would have been returned.
const getUser = user => { name: user.name } // always returns undefined
But if we try to ""return"" an object that has more than 1 property, SyntaxError gets thrown.
const getUser = user => { name: user.name, age: user.age } // SyntaxError",2,0

76. What's the output?
const { firstName: myName } = { firstName: 'Lydia' };

console.log(firstName);

A: ""Lydia""
B: ""myName""
C: undefined
D: ReferenceError

Answer

Answer: D
By using destructuring assignment syntax we can unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables:
const { firstName } = { firstName: 'Lydia' };
// ES5 version:
// var firstName = { firstName: 'Lydia' }.firstName;

console.log(firstName); // ""Lydia""
Also, a property can be unpacked from an object and assigned to a variable with a different name than the object property:
const { firstName: myName } = { firstName: 'Lydia' };
// ES5 version:
// var myName = { firstName: 'Lydia' }.firstName;

console.log(myName); // ""Lydia""
console.log(firstName); // Uncaught ReferenceError: firstName is not defined
Therefore, firstName does not exist as a variable, thus attempting to access its value will raise a ReferenceError.
Note: Be aware of the global scope properties:
const { name: myName } = { name: 'Lydia' };

console.log(myName); // ""lydia""
console.log(name); // """" ---- Browsers e.g. Chrome
console.log(name); // ReferenceError: name is not defined  ----- NodeJS
Whenever Javascript is unable to find a variable within the current scope, it climbs up the Scope chain and searches for it and if it reaches the top-level scope, aka Global scope, and still doesn't find it, it will throw a ReferenceError.


In Browsers such as Chrome, name is a deprecated global scope property. In this example, the code is running inside global scope and there is no user defined local variable for name, therefore it searches the predefined variables/properties in the global scope which is in case of browsers, it searches through window object and it will extract the window.name value which is equal to an empty string.


In NodeJS, there is no such property on the global object, thus attempting to access a non-existent variable will raise a ReferenceError.",3,0

Added Shqip translation files to the  directory.
Updated the documentation to reflect this new language addition.
