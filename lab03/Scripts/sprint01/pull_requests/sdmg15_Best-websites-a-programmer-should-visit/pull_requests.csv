A code of conduct is important because it promotes moral behavior, acts as a guideline for ethical decision making, enhances the reputation of an organization, prevents negative legal effects, encourages positive relationships, acts as a reference for solving ethical dilemmas and prevents discrimination or harassment.
Harassment and abuse are significant factors in preventing the entire community of tech companies, user groups, open source projects, and other organizations and events from being truly diverse and welcoming to participation.
Also, a well-written code of conduct clarifies an organization's mission, values and principles, linking them with standards of professional conduct.
This aligns well with this project's inferred mission of helping people becoming better programmers and software professionals.
@sdmg15 as this repository' maintainer, you are setting the example for thousands of other developers. You can contribute to making this community, GitHub, and the world a better place by fostering a welcoming, diverse and inclusive culture! You've got a great power in your hands, but with great power comes a great responsibility üôÇ
