Like JavaScript linting, Markdown linting can help identify errors or constructs that not all Markdown renderers handle correctly. The linter caught a few bugs in the README.
If you disagree with any of how I've gone about this, please let me know, and I'm happy to change things.
If you disagree with the intent of this completely, then oh well, it was a fun exercise. 😄
Lint Rules
My intent is to codify the existing style being used, rather than to try to change how Markdown is written in this repo.

I've set a catchall to enable all of the Markdownlint Rules and subsequently disabled ones that don't apply. If you'd instead like an explicit list of rules that do apply (to avoid updates to markdownlint silently adding new rules), I can do that instead.
I disabled a rule when it appeared that one of the documents deliberately did not conform to it. (Even if this nonconformance only happened once, I disabled the rule globally rather than for that one occurrence in the document).
I changed document content to fix rule nonconformance when it appeared that:

There was a legitimate bug in the document (meaning either GitHub or another Markdown renderer would not render something correctly)
A rule was followed consistently, except for a few isolated cases



Implementation
A new lint npm script has been added to the top-level package.json, and set as a pretest script, to match how lint scripts in subpackages are handled. The top-level travis script now also explicitly invokes lint.
There is now a devDependency on markdownlint-cli but not markdownlint. The JavaScript implementation of Markdownlint is a library only, and unfortunately the CLI wrapper markdownlint-cli has a dependency, rather than a peerDependency, on markdownlint.
