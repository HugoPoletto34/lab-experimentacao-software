ChatGPT response
\begin{claim}
For any $0 \leq n$, there exists $\Gamma_t^n$ and $\Gamma^{n+1}$ such that $\Gamma^{n+1}$ is a minimal-unsatisfying formulae set, where
[
\Gamma^{n+1} = \Gamma_t^n \cup {\psi'}
]
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
Let $v$ be a satisfying valuation of $\Gamma_t^n$, i.e. $v \vDash \Gamma_t^n$.

First, we show that there exists a formula $\psi'$ such that $v \nvDash \psi'$. We can construct such a formula by negating one of the atomic propositions in $\Gamma_t^n$, i.e. $\psi' = \neg p_i$ for some $1 \leq i \leq n$. Since $v \vDash \Gamma_t^n$, we know that $v(p_i) = 1$. Therefore, $v(\neg p_i) = 0$, and $v \nvDash \psi'$.

Next, we show that $\Gamma^{n+1} = \Gamma_t^n \cup {\psi'}$ is a minimal-unsatisfying formulae set. This means that there is no proper subset of $\Gamma^{n+1}$ that is satisfiable. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there exists a proper subset $\Gamma' \subset \Gamma^{n+1}$ such that $v \vDash \Gamma'$. Since $\Gamma'$ is a proper subset of $\Gamma^{n+1}$, we know that $\psi' \notin \Gamma'$. Therefore, $\Gamma' \subseteq \Gamma_t^n$, and $v \vDash \Gamma_t^n$. However, this contradicts our assumption that $v \nvDash \psi'$, since $\psi'$ is a formula that is not satisfied by $v$. Therefore, no proper subset of $\Gamma^{n+1}$ is satisfiable, and $\Gamma^{n+1}$ is a minimal-unsatisfying formulae set.

Since we have shown that there exists a formula $\psi'$ such that $v \nvDash \psi'$ and $\Gamma^{n+1} = \Gamma_t^n \cup {\psi'}$ is a minimal-unsatisfying formulae set, the claim holds for any $0 \leq n$.
\end{proof}

Note: The above proof uses the concepts of satisfying valuations and minimal-unsatisfying formulae sets in propositional logic. It may be helpful to have a basic understanding of these concepts before reading the proof.
