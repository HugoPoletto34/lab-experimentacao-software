57,2021-07-16T04:25:13Z,,2021-07-22T06:18:42Z,2,98,27,"Greetings fellow HKer!
Using multiple A Records in a DNS result is a well established method of providing redundancy. The problem is that Node.js's networking is one of the few that does not handle this gracefully (discussed in here almost 5 years ago). If one of the servers Timeout and node happen to request it first, it will be shown as DOWN, but browsers can visit the site no problem since they will try all the servers simultaneously. In my case it's unfortunately a deal-breaker as I don't have full control over the DNS, and one of the IPs returned is always down.
Here I have worked out a minimal viable fix for the problem by using async to try all the servers in parallel, and return if one of them has a successful response. Ideally I think the UI should also support displaying multiple servers for a hostname, but I would like to know your thoughts on that first.",5,3

This pull request implements the retry functionality mentioned in #21
It follows the outlined draft (#56) pretty closely, except for a bit more frontend fixes to display the correct color and strings when the service is pending (retrying)
Also for now, if a service enters the retry condition, hearbeats with that status do not count towards the uptime calculation.
This change requires a database migration for existing uptime kuma installations.
The new table looks like this:
CREATE TABLE ""monitor"" (
	""id""	INTEGER NOT NULL,
	""name""	VARCHAR(150),
	""active""	BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
	""user_id""	INTEGER,
	""interval""	INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 20,
	""url""	TEXT,
	""type""	VARCHAR(20),
	""weight""	INTEGER DEFAULT 2000,
	""hostname""	VARCHAR(255),
	""port""	INTEGER,
	""created_date""	TIMESTAMP,
	""keyword""	VARCHAR(255),
	""maxretries""	INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
	PRIMARY KEY(""id"" AUTOINCREMENT),
	FOREIGN KEY(""user_id"") REFERENCES ""user""(""id"") ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

The monitor table received another field maxretries
The required migration script is NOT part of this PR, however the initial database has been updated accordingly.

The current method of implementation only shows the template options when it has been specifically enabled for that notification type. This is to allow testing of templates for each notification method individually.
For all existing notifications, because the option is empty, it uses the ""low detail"" template, which is the current message received from most notifications. This is also the default value in the drop-down for newly created templates.
I realized while writing this that it might be best to pass the templates in via the front-end instead of just their name as that would allow them to easily be added to the translation files, and make it easier to modify the templates available when based on the notification (adding specific templates for discord detail levels for example). The current templates are also only starting points, and I feel not the best matches to their namesakes, so I welcome input there.
The testing of a notification now passes in a test heartbeat and monitor, but it is not perfect. They should ideally loop through different values so that the user can test complex templates easily.
The generation of the template argument really should be pulled out to it's own function. Specifically to have the most common keys such as name and health to not require monitor.name and monitor.health etc. as well as to add data for the names used in #627 for compatibility. This would also move the ""healthy/unhealthy"" to a set location.

The current behavior is unchanged. The new default will be ""recent"", since the last 100 beats doesn't really correspond to a specific time period. Currently available options are 3h, 6h, 24h, 1w. Since these are manually triggered when the user selects, I don't think performance will be a big concern.
Slight issue: Updating the period will cause the heartbeat bar animation to trigger, since the data structure is shared. I don't see any easy solution to this.
In the future we can make the default period configurable, but should the Chart component handle this? Or should the LIMIT 100 be configurable?",4,7

Users seem to have trouble with configuring HTTP ""basic"" auth. This PR adds new inputs for HTTP(s) and Keyword monitors to set HTTP ""basic"" auth username and password. These are encoded in Base64 and added to the headers of the request.
This makes adding endpoints with HTTP ""basic"" authentication a bit more user-friendly, not requiring manual encoding and adding to the Headers section. However, the old way still works and ""basic"" auth monitors created before the upgrade should continue working normally.

UX issue
When having lots of monitors and groups (hence having to scroll down to see the bottom of the list), adding a new group to the status page is a frustrating experience :

when the user clicks the + Add Group  button, nothing moves on the visible part of the screen (the new entry is added at the bottom)
the user has to scroll all the way down to find the new group entry

And when adding multiple groups, the user experiences repeatedly having to scroll up and down
Proposed change
Instead of adding the new group entry at the bottom of the page, add the new group entry at the top

Make console logging more consistent and prepare for potential fail2ban integration. Log output follows a strict scheme:
$TIMESTAMP_UTC_ISO8601 [$MODULE] $LOGLEVEL: $MESSAGE
Before:
console.error(""Start Uptime-Kuma failed due to issue patching the database"");
After:
console.error(""2021-11-10T05:41:33.571Z [DB] ERROR: Start Uptime-Kuma failed due to issue patching the database"");
Timestamps are UTC in ISO8601 format (for now, not sure whether this should be a localized timestamp based on the server's TZ). The ""module"" name is arbitrary but should be chosen to represent the log source (e.g. ""db"" for the server/database.js). For the authentication parts in server/server.js I chose ""auth"" to make this more specific. For notification-providers/matrix.js I chose a more general ""notification"". You get the point.
I also added some new log messages for logins and 2fa authentication. Reason: in the future I want to monitor Uptime Kuma's logs via fail2ban and ban IPs on ISO/OSI layer 3 if someone is penetrating my UK server or trying to login with unknown usernames etc. The current rate limit feature is nice but it's ISO/OSI layer 7 blocking ""only"". If some IP is attacking UK, might be worth to block all TCP/UDP traffic for that IP - not just rate limit it for UK.

Status, ping and uptime badges, generated in node-js, no internet access required (based on badge-maker aka. shields.io)
This PR adds three API endpoints returning a SVG graphic for a given (public) monitor:
Status
<kuma-url>/api/badge/:monitorID/status e.g. <kuma-url>/api/badge/1/status returning sth like:

Ping
<kuma-url>/api/badge/:monitorID/ping/:duration e.g. <kuma-url>/api/badge/1/ping returning sth like:

Uptime
<kuma-url>/api/badge/:monitorID/uptime/:duration e.g. <kuma-url>/api/badge/1/uptime/24 returning sth like:

Status badge
There are options to customize the status badge's appearance: upLabel = Up, downLabel = Down, upColor, downColor:
<kuma-url>/api/badge/<monitorId>/status?upLabel=<upLabel>&downLabel=<downLabel>

<kuma-url>/api/badge/<monitorId>/status?upColor=white&downColor=black

Ping and uptime badge
There are options to customize the ping and uptime badge's text: labelPrefix, label, labelSuffix = h, prefix, suffix = ms / %, color, labelColor:
<kuma-url>/api/badge/<monitorId>/ping/24?labelPrefix=<labelPrefix>&label=<label>&labelSuffix=<labelSuffix>&prefix=<prefix>&suffix=<suffix>

<kuma-url>/api/badge/<monitorId>/uptime/24?labelPrefix=<labelPrefix>&label=<label>&labelSuffix=<labelSuffix>&prefix=<prefix>&suffix=<suffix>

The given time interval has to be in 'hours', but customizing options allow for a different display:
<kuma-url>/api/badge/1/uptime/720?label=30&labelSuffix=d

The default uptime badge's color is based on the uptime percentage:

but can be overwritten with predefined color or any other color in HEX code:

See https://shields.io/#colors for predefined colors.
Different badge styles as defined by https://shields.io/#styles are also supported. (thx @throwabird / comment )

Use of the following options to enable them: flat (default), flat-square, plastic, for-the-badge, social:

Rewrite complex (SQLite-only) queries to knex format
Fixes #959 #953
However there is still much work to be done. The current implementation is not backwards compatible with existing databases - there is only one migration, from nothing (blank DB) to current version.
To do

 convert old db migrations to knex migrations
 add support for other DBs in knexfile.js
 wait for knex contributors to fix ""table-creator.js"" issue
 decide how to install additional db drivers

Fixes #857 and #694
Due to the calling of setpriv as an regular user and some weird env variable stuff which seemed set wrongly to me the application couldn't be launched in docker as a non-root user.
(And really, an application like this shouldn't run as root as it simply doesn't need it)
The proposed fix properly sets the environment variables reflecting the actual UID and GID and asseses this before launching.

An user switching an existing setup from root to non-root user might need to manually chown the /app/data directory once depending on how they set up the storage. This does not involve altering any container files.

The Mattermost integration currently has a small problem, which is if the name of the channel include Upper Case letters like Uptime-Alerts the backend will trigger a ""Couldn't find the channel"" error. This happens because the Mattermost expects the channel name in url in Lower Case as uptime-alerts.
People who use lower case letters for channels will not face this issue, but people who use Upper Case in channel will get above error.

Fixes #1422.
The goal is to avoid the race condition caused by creating heartbeats and checking them in two different, asynchronous functions, which is exacerbated by the possible drift of heartbeat checking due to setTimeout behavior.
The basic idea is that before we do a setTimeout(beat), we check when the last heartbeat arrived, and adjust the timeout such that the next check happens 1 heartbeat interval after the last heartbeat. This prevents the heartbeat check from drifting relative to the api call (which usually happens on a fixed interval like a cron job).
A 1s buffer time is added to that timeout to ensure that the heartbeat check happens after the api call is expected. This helps avoid the race condition that occurs when the heartbeat check and api call happen simultaneously (which they will tend to do). The buffer time may need to be increased, but the tradeoff is a delay in when the DOWN notification is sent in the event of a missed heartbeat.
It may be desirable to make the buffer time user-controlled.
Right now, retries aren't explicitly addressed. I would propose that in the case of missed heartbeats, the monitor reverts to checking exactly every heartbeat interval (i.e. ignoring the time of the last heartbeat).
This seemed to me to be the best way to address the issue without making huge architectural changes (i.e. make the heartbeat checking happen in the router function).
Please let me know if this all looks ok and I can finish it up, and finish testing, linting/formatting, etc.

Fixes #1059
This PR should fully implement #1059. When the user selects the DNS monitor option, a new input box has been added below the resolver address allowing the user to implement the port to access the resolver on. This uses the same monitor.port as the TCP monitor but a monitor has been added to prefill the port value to the default of 53 if the value in this field has not already been set. This is then cleared if the user selects a different monitor type and has not changed the port value. A translation has also been added explaining what this field does in order to reduce any confusion. JSDoc documentation has also been added to the dnsResolve function in util-server.js.

Potential fix for #1556 which my guess is that when 1.15.0 was released, the local build used an old copy of the base image from @louislam development environment.
Ideally every time that npm run build-docker is executed we also rebuild the base images, that way base dependencies and cloudflared will get updated to their latest version.
This PR mainly adds the two commands for building the base images to npm run build docker, it also adds the --no-cache flag to each docker build command which discourages Docker Daemon from using local cache.

2022-05-02 15:19:51,832 - INFO - Sent Zulip notification to <stream>.

To fix this scenario, this pull request adds an environment variable APPRISE_NOTIFICATION_TITLE that can be used to include the title argument in the call to apprise.
In an ideal world, the title would be derived from the data that's passed into the send function, but this would be a breaking change. The approach proposed in this pull request is fully backwards compatible as a user of uptime-kuma must explicitly opt-in to the new behavior by setting the new environment variable.

Testing
you can start a testing radius server with the following Dockerfile
FROM freeradius/freeradius-server:latest

RUN mkdir -p /etc/raddb/mods-config/files/

RUN echo ""client net {""                 > /etc/raddb/clients.conf
RUN echo ""    ipaddr = 172.17.0.0/16""  >> /etc/raddb/clients.conf
RUN echo ""    secret = testing123""     >> /etc/raddb/clients.conf
RUN echo ""}""                           >> /etc/raddb/clients.conf

RUN echo ""bob Cleartext-Password := \""testpw\"""" > /etc/raddb/mods-config/files/authorize

and starting the docker container like this:
docker run --rm --name radius -p 1812:1812/udp $(docker build -q .) -X

The following values can be used in the uptime-kuma check to test the local radius server:
Hostname = localhost
Radius Username = bob
Radius Password = testpw
Radius Secret = testing123

Fixes #1430
Hi, I'd like to expand on issue #1430 to use Uptime Kuma to monitor Sql Server more closely. We currently use the TCP options, but this returns ""online"" when the server port is open, but the database is offline.
There is already a node package for connecting to Sql Server: https://www.npmjs.com/package/mssql. Ideally this pr will just copy the logic you have already done for ping/https, but use the mssql package.
New Inputs Specific to Monitor
Connection String
The inputs would be a complete connection string (Server=localhost,1433;Database=database;User Id=username;Password=password;Encrypt=true), as this is the most flexible way to connect. There are optional parameters in the connection string, and having dropdown for each one would be very messy compared to using just a connection string.
Query to run
While we could hardcode a query select getdate();, there are many opinions of what query should be run. Putting this as a parameter would be the most flexible.
The workflow will be:

connect - when connection fails, monitor fails
attempt to run sql - when query runs ok, the monitor passes, when query fails, monitor fails.

Type of change

New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality) - Option to monitor SQL Server
Added migration with 2 generic database columns so this can be expanded to postgres.

Main changes

The default value for connection string was moved from value to placeholder. I'm not sure how to create multiple default values for a v-model that change based on the select, so I used the template to change the input placeholder, which performs basically the same function.
Using the node-postgres (pg) module for the connection
Using already existing db fields

Because of brianc/node-postgres#1927 (pg has an issue where if you put a non-string (no password) password the app crashes), I added a check to verify that the password is not empty. The password library (also from pg) returns """" if the password is blank. If we get that, then reject.
Here's what comes if we don't check:
throw new Error('SASL: SCRAM-SERVER-FIRST-MESSAGE: client password must be a string')

Creates Parody Between Statistics Shown In The Dashboard and Available Badges.
Reasoning
Issues such as #2176 show there is a clear need for full feature and name parity between the dashboard and badge system for simplicity.
Execution
I have created a new set of badges under /api/badge/:id/ to cover the parody.  I have also changed the default label for /api/badge/:id/ping/:duration? and /api/badge/:id/uptime/:duration? to reflect the new badges.
All badges have the same options as the previous badge system.
Badges
Note: All examples are from https://google.com.
Status:
Shows the status of the monitor. (Existing badge) /api/badge/:id/status

Response:
Shows the response (ping) of the monitor. /api/badge/:id/response

Removed unnecessary compareVersions: we were comparing the same var on both sides res.data.beta, so it will always be equal.

Description
This adds a new setting and uses the official Telegram Bot API to allow delivering (sending) notifications silently, this is especially useful, if you have Telegram app open, or want to just not receive some of the service notifications urgently.
Note: There is no change in default behavior, as it stays ""false"" by default, as in ""not silent"".

Read more about silent messages here: https://telegram.org/blog/channels-2-0#silent-messages
Handy API reference for /sendMessage from Telegram API: https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#sendmessage

This does increase the payload size being sent to Telegram for each notification ever-so-slightly, however, I don't think it's worth increasing the code complexity for sending the notification with default behavior (not silent) and relying default behavior of Telegram.
Explicit is best, basically, but happy to adjust the code if requested.

Adds the feature of cloning existing monitor, I have briefly tested it with ping and https and ensured that all properties was cloned including notifications.
Flow:

Click on an existing monitor
Click clone -> User is redirected to /clone/ExistingMonitorId
Change fields
Click save -> User is redirected to /dashboard/NewMonitorId

Note: Tags will not be copied when cloning a monitor. The TagsManager component is a bit complicated and I did not want to spend that much more time on it.

Description
Currently there is no time limit on error messages (20s for warnings); this behavior can be very annoying: the user has to close many notifications before being able to use the interface.
To remedy this, the following should/could be changed:

Setting the timeout for toast notifications (0 or blank: no timeout). It can be set in the settings menu, separately for warnings and errors.
Option to close all notification windows in one step.

Fixes #2116
Comments

Please update the style of the button ""Delete Notifications"" in file Layout.vue if you want.

It is generally a bad idea to use user credentials when making a request to an API/monitoring endpoint. This PR would allow the user to create and use API keys to access the Prometheus metrics page instead of using user credentials. In order to provide backwards compatibility, basic auth will continue to be used if the user has not defined any API keys.

Commit message:
Fixes #2628
A sanity check is performed when calculating the uptime of a monitor on status page. If it is greater than 100%, we just show 100%. This hasn't been implemented on the dashboard at the request of @louislam due to concerns it would make debugging more difficult in future if changes were made to the uptime calculation.

Preperation for #898 (#680).
Exposing it with getPrometheus for #2491.
Removed the call server.monitorList[monitor.id]?.prometheus()?.remove(); as editMonitor always restarts the monitor and does the remove already in monitor.stop.

Thought I split #898 in some smaller changes to make it more simple to review.

Description
Hello Guys,
I saw that many users requested a grouping feature... and I also wanted one. So I added it.
You can group services however and how deep you like.
The group always takes the state of the worsted child. If all are green and one in red. The whole group will be red.

This means you can set your notification at the parent level and get one message instead of 10 if something is broken.
Also, if you want to do maintenance, you can just set it at the parent and all children go into maintenance too.

The same happens if you pause the group.

To add a group, simply add a monitor and select ""group"" as its type.

To add monitors to this group, just edit the monitor and select the group in the ""monitor group"" dropdown.

If you create subgroups, it can look like this:

And of course, if one item in the subgroup fails, the subgroups fails and also the main group itself.
In text fields, subgroups are displayed using slashes like this Cloud / HTTPS.
And your state, which group is collapsed and which not, gets saved in your browser.
In your status page, you can now simply select the group to get displayed instead of every single service separately.
This makes the status page more simple and better for your normal users.

 I have read and understand the pull request rules.

Description
Fixes #2353
Currently it's not possible to add a remote docker daemon that is secured with TLS because in this case the client needs to include the client side TLS certificate, issued by the docker host's CA, in every request.
This PR adds the ability to include client side certificate in HTTPS requests to docker hosts by looking for the certificate files at a specified location in the file system and including them in requests. Certificates for multiple docker hosts can be made available to Kuma as described below.
The base path where certificates are looked for can be set with the DOCKER_TLS_DIR_PATH environmental variable or defaults to data/docker-tls/.
If a directory in this path exists with a name matching the FQDN of the docker host (e.g. the FQDN of https://example.com:2376 is example.com so the directory data/docker-tls/example.com/ would be searched for certificate files), then ca.pem, key.pem and cert.pem files are loaded and included in the agent options. File names can also be overridden via DOCKER_TLS_FILE_NAME_(CA|KEY|CERT).

Description
Basically a continuation of #751, but only for Webhook notifications.
There is a trend of people using the Webhook notification type for other notification providers, but the body does not conform to the need of specific providers, therefore errors are encountered (#3087, #3084, #2967, #2960, #2845, #1160, #949). Allowing users to define a custom body would make Webhook actually useful.
This still doesn't solve the case for variables in query string tho. (#2813)

Description
This is a feature proposal to discuss the implementation of a new functionality within Uptime Kuma that would allow the use of custom flags for command-line tools. A prime example of this feature's application is Tailscale integration, as detailed in issue #1981 (Tailscale Ping Integration).
Consider the Tailscale example: by enabling custom flags, users could substitute a standard ICMP ping with tailscale ping, resulting in improved security (respecting ACLs) and better network segmentation. The utility of this feature extends to numerous other scenarios, enhancing Uptime Kuma's adaptability and versatility.
I've initiated this pull request to foster discussion and to collect feedback from maintainers and members alike on these proposed changes.
Proposed Changes
The proposed changes include:

Introducing a custom flag option that allows users to define their monitoring commands and expected responses.
Demonstrating this feature with a Tailscale implementation, leveraging the ""tailscale ping "" command as an alternative to the standard ICMP ""ping "" for device monitoring.

By introducing a feature allowing users to define their own monitoring commands and expected responses, we enable them to utilize specific tools or protocols, such as Tailscale, for their monitoring needs; It extends Uptime Kuma's functionality, catering to a broader range of monitoring requirements and scenarios.

Description
During the Review of #3176 I noticed that the Notification Providers are written in diverse styles.
This means, that reviewing them is sometimes less rigorous in terms of reviewing code quality.
Generally, the PRs for Providers this project gets are based upon the existing codebase and do not reinvent the wheel.
⇒ establishing a common formatting aids reviewability.
I have merged these four things, as I think they are related and don't impact each other much.
If preferred, I can break them out of this PR/ drop the commits.
Now to the changes I am proposing:

I unified where in file the name of NotificationProvider.name is placed
I made sure that all the providers adhere to the signature of NotificationProvider.send()
I made sure that all the providers use okMsg if returning success messages directly from the function.
Here a discussion should be had:
Should this be refactored into a constant of NotificationProvider? I could imagine that NotificationProvider.SENDING_SUCCESSFULL  could be a suitable alternative.
I made sure all providers have the URL they POST/GET to be extraced into a variable.
=> refactored this way due to Nelsons suggestion

Does this violate the community guidelines?
I know that this PR may go against these two rules from the community guidelines:


Existing logic is completely modified or deleted for no reason
⇒ See above discussion if we should extract NotificationProvider.SENDING_SUCCESSFULL or okMsg


Unnecessary large code changes (Hard to review, causes code conflicts to other pull requests)
⇒ I think that these changes being in one PR makes it easier to review than if :

being split by proposed change
being split by touched module

Description
Fixes #3185. Untested. If the monitor timeout becomes configurable in the future this can be passed the same variable.
While searching for the documentation of node-radius-client, I found out the repository that npm pointed to has disappeared from public view (https://github.com/w3cj/node-radius-client). IMO this is a pretty bad situation as we will be unable to raise issues if any were found. But there seems to be no alternative to this package so I guess we will have to stick to the status quo.

Description
Fixes #3259
I thought about adding a serverside translation library (like i18next), but each library has subtly different ways of handling things like regional fallbacks, interpolation etc. It's just not worth introducing another library to handle this. Also, if there exist an API for the server, we would not expect the returned messages to be translated. Hence I think we should focus on internationalization being a frontend problem only. But on the other hand, we may not want the frontend to display translated messages just because a key happens to be available. Therefore I arrived at this solution.
TODO: Add msgi18n to all translatible msg, add corresponding keys to en.json.
