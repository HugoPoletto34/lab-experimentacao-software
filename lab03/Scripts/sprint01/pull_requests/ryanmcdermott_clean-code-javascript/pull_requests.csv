...only to override this assertion later with ""Use default arguments instead of short circuiting.""


This is a poor design-choice for an advisory document.

If you are going to say x > y,
then later say z > x,
you should just say z > x > y upfront.
Otherwise, many people might not see the z > x later on,
because many people will probably use this as a referential document. They probably won't read the entire work.",2,4
