.shadcn-uirc file written in JSON or YAML.

I use corepack, which automatically picks the version of pnpm found in package.json → packageManager. Because this version has been out of date, I’ve been getting a pretty massive diff in pnpm-lock.yaml on pnpm install.

Bumping the value of packageManager locally has fixed this. Going forward, you can use something like Renovate bot which will keep packageManager version in sync with the latest available version.

Body:
Hi ,
I've made some updates to fix an issue with the Accordion trigger icon shrinking when the text gets too long. Here are the changes I've made:


Added the class name ""shrink-0"" to the ChevronDown icon to prevent it from shrinking


Added the class name ""text-left"" to the AccordionPrimitive.Trigger to left-align the text
I've tested these changes locally and they fix the issue. Please review and merge the pull request when you have a chance.

Summary
This PR adds the ""@radix-ui/react-slot"" dependency to the FormField component. This addition is meant to streamline the DX and align it with the existing standards in the Button component.
Changes
The following text has been changed, from:
npm install react-hook-form zod @hookform/resolvers

to:
npm install react-hook-form zod @hookform/resolvers @radix-ui/react-slot

Additional Details
It's important to note that the ""@radix-ui/react-slot"" dependency is already being utilized in the Button component. However, the current next-template still uses an older version without ""@radix-ui/react-slot"" implementation.
Given that the installation guide for the Button component recommends installing ""@radix-ui/react-slot"", it seems fitting to include this in the FormField component as well. This not only brings consistency across components but also paves the way for updating the template to utilize ""@radix-ui/react-slot"".
I look forward to your feedback and appreciate your consideration of this PR!",2,2

Summary
In this PR, I've added the TailwindCSS class ""aspect-square"" to the RadioGroupItem component in apps/www/components/ui/radio-group.tsx. This change enhances the visual consistency of radio buttons across different device sizes and widths.
Changes
Here's a snippet of the code change:
From:
className={cn(
  ""h-4 w-4 rounded-full border border-primary text-primary ring-offset-background focus:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:cursor-not-allowed disabled:opacity-50"",
  className
)}
To:
className={cn(
  ""aspect-square h-4 w-4 rounded-full border border-primary text-primary ring-offset-background focus:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:cursor-not-allowed disabled:opacity-50"",
  className
)}
Rationale and Impact
Previously, the absence of the ""aspect-square"" class resulted in distorted shapes of radio button circles on smaller devices or at smaller widths. Here is a visual demonstration of the issue:
.
By introducing the ""aspect-square"" class, the radio buttons maintain their circular shape regardless of device size or width, as demonstrated here:
.
This change improves the user experience by maintaining a visually consistent interface across different device sizes and widths.

However, out of the box the extension has pretty limited (or focused) areas where the IntelliSense will kick in.
This change expands the number of places where the Tailwind extension will provide IntelliSense support.
Any object with Styles (case sensitive) in the name will now trigger IntelliSense.  This is particularly useful in places like Button. Previously, no IntelliSense was provided to the buttonVariant styles.
With this change (and some moving around), all buttonVariant styles have IntelliSense support.
Example:

Note: The core change is to add "".*Styles*"" to the list of tailwindCSS.classAttributes which is where Tailwind knows to look in the file for IntelliSense. This was added to the root settings.json as well as the settings.json under the template.",3,9

Hey there! It appears that this issue has not received any attention yet. I encountered a similar situation yesterday while working on a project, where I had to manually change the components' prefixes. Hence, it seems imperative to address this matter in some way.
This pr introduces a valuable addition to the CLI. It allows users to define a custom Tailwind prefixes.
The implementation updates both the configuration schema, the init command and the tailwind config templates. The configuration schema now includes a new optional field called ""prefix."" This will ensures that users who have already customized their configuration won't be required to make any further updates. And, the CLI will not throw any errors with existing configurations.

I was recently setting up the UI for the first time and I didn't read the step description properly, which lead to misconfiguring my project (my mistake, ofc).
I thought others could also stumble across this, so I've changed the installation step description to explicitly represent tsconfig.json structure.

I hope you're doing well. I've created this pull request to propose an enhancement to the shadcn-uI library. I've added position and size variants to the Dialog component, which I believe would enhance the versatility and usability of the library.
Changes Made:
Added new position options (left, center, right, top-left, top-center, top-right,  bottom-left, bottom-center, bottom-right) to the Dialog component.
Included size options (small, medium, large, extra-large, super-large, ultra-large, full) to allow for greater flexibility in adapting the dialog to different content needs.
I kindly request you to review this pull request at your earliest convenience. Your feedback and suggestions are highly valued, and I'm open to making any necessary adjustments to ensure the quality and cohesion of the library.

This PR changes the components that use the DialogPortal element to be aliases rather than components that pass a className prop.
The DialogPortalProps type from @radix/react-dialog recently had a patch update that probably should have been a minor or maybe a major update which is causing a few people to see the error Property 'className' does not exist on type 'DialogPortalProps'.
Since the DialogPortal component doesn't actually output any DOM elements, it never technically supported the className prop and the fact that it surfaced that prop was really a bug.

Upon investigating the issue, seems like the cmdk input infers the value from whatever is provided above. However, here's a scenario where that ends up being an issue:

visit components/combobox
search for 'Next.js'
now add a whitespace at the end
see how it returns no results
remove the whitespace
see that the search doesn't return next.js and you need to delete the entire value for it to work

So this solution fixes the demo by providing a value to CommandItem so its value is not inferred
<CommandItem
  key={framework.value}
  onSelect={(currentValue) => {
    setValue(currentValue === value ? """" : currentValue)
    setOpen(false)
  }}
  value={framework.value}
>
However, an issue with this: this solution doesn't work, for example, to the TeamSwitcher since the value currently provided inside the content array doesn't match what the user sees (i.e., if you search for Alicia Koch but you've added
<CommandItem
  key={team.value}
  onSelect={() => {
    setSelectedTeam(team)
    setOpen(false)
  }}
  className=""text-sm""
  value={team.value}
>
It won't return any results since the alicia koch object looks like this:
{
  label: ""Alicia Koch"",
  value: ""personal"",
},",4,2

Rationale for this PR
This PR changes the TypeScript execution package for use in scripts like build:registry from ts-node to tsx. This is because ts-node has many difficult quirks to work through (and is slow). In addition, it also has a difficult to understand error for newcomers that is reproducible.
The ts-node error
As shown in #1926, using ts-node (specifically in build:registry) results in this error: Unknown file extension "".ts"" for /ui/apps/www/scripts/build-registry.ts. There are many issues in the ts-node repository documenting this problem:

TypeStrong/ts-node/issues/1062
TypeStrong/ts-node/issues/2033
TypeStrong/ts-node/issues/1997

Switching the typescript-in-node system to tsx, which uses esbuild under the hood, resolves this error.

While making these changes I realised aria-selected is also being used for styling, so I switched this to use the data attribute, data-selected, which is applied by cmdk.
I created an issue on cmdk repo here, pacocoursey/cmdk#192 and will follow this but there is no indication when this will be addressed or if there will be a new release.

What's an alias?
An alias is an import alias. You can think of it as How do I write imports for my components or utils?.
If you write import { Button } from ""@/components/button"" then @/components is your alias. import { AlertDialog } from ""~/app/ui/alert-dialog"" has alias ~/app/ui.
We use aliases instead of paths because it tells us more about your project setup. Using aliases, we can figure out components paths and automatically resolve imports when adding new components.",7,8

Description
In the example of documentation :
Pagination>
      <PaginationContent>
        <PaginationItem>
          <PaginationPrevious href=""#"" />
        </PaginationItem>
        <PaginationItem>
          <PaginationLink href=""#"">1</PaginationLink>
        </PaginationItem>
        <PaginationItem>
          <PaginationEllipsis />
        </PaginationItem>
        <PaginationItem>
          <PaginationNext href=""#"" />
        </PaginationItem>
      </PaginationContent>
    </Pagination>

We use the component <PaginationItem> which is a li element to wrap the <PaginationLink> which is also wrapped by <PaginationItem/> internally.
This will produce:
<li>
<li>
....
</li>
</li>

2428,2024-01-15T03:12:23Z,,2024-03-19T06:02:54Z,27,1217,4,"This PR is a preview that adds an accessible component called OTPInput based on the react-otp-input that allows to render as many inputs as you want (based on the Input component of shadcn) through a numInputs prop so that a user can write OTP verification codes in an accessible way.
The component allows:

Copy and paste from clipboard
Auto focus
Move through inputs with arrows and keyboard tabs
Delete code and move the focus to the previous input
Type a character and move the focus to the next input
Setter and getter props to control component values
Input of type hidden to allow to have an input with an id that we pass as prop ready for RSC or forms that require to capture data from formData

Pending tasks:

Document the component
Fix a focus use case where if the user moves the focus to a different input than the first one and starts typing, the characters start to be inserted from the first input instead of the focused input.

2799,2024-02-20T12:20:41Z,,2024-02-21T06:28:58Z,2,27,19,"Description of Code Change
Purpose
The goal of a code change is to increase stability and readability by reducing repetition and improving code organization.
Previous Implementation
Previously, the Icons object contained individual functions for each icon, where each function had the type IconProps explicitly defined. This approach led to repetitive code and increased the likelihood of errors if the type needed to be updated.
Updated Implementation
In the updated implementation, the Icons object now uses a more concise approach by defining a type for the icon components and leveraging TypeScript's type inference capabilities. The new approach utilizes the IconComponents type, which defines an object where the keys are strings representing icon names, and the values are functions accepting IconProps and returning JSX elements.",2,1
