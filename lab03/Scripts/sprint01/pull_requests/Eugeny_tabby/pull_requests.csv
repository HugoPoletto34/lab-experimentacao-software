This is to address the first issue raised in #47.
The changes to the package.jsons are done automatically by npm (I'm using npm v5). If you'd like to not include those changes, please let me know.
I've tested this out and it seems to work, however, it seems that terminus does not support 256 colors, because colors 17-21 appear as black/ blue (https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell#troubleshooting)",2,2

I took a stab myself for this feature, while I also have relatively high confidence PR is not feasible to be accepted.
This PR exposes one more settings values to allow cycle tab selection, either next / previous tab hotkey will select to last / first tab if user specifies to.
point of consideration


may possible to control this behavior via plugin instead of core?
: I couldn't find relative interface support, but maybe I am lack of knowledge simply.


Is it feasible to expose under application settings, under appearance?
: It isn't actually appearance but more about behavior, while current settings doesn't have specific category. Hotkey provider is managing assigned key combination, so picked current one instead.


Would it be better to have checkbox instead of radio?
: this may not be big deal (and could reuse all styles), but still this could be checkbox for boolean flag.",2,2

This commit adds rename to the tab right click dialog, as well as adds a hotkey (defaults to CTRL+SHIFT+R) to improve QOL.
One final change was to automatically select the text in the input of the RenameTab dialog.
