Some lists include sections for books, podcasts and etc ... (like this one includes links to app stores and discussion sites).
Would be nice to have a podcasts section here, especially taking into account that many Apple related podcasts are analytical and mainly discuss rumors.
Mac Power Users is a productivity-oriented one. They discuss applications, MacOS, tips, work and integration with other Apple devices, interview software authors and just well-known in the community people (productivity geeks, artists who use Apple professionally ...).
There is quite a big community built around the podcast (sometimes the authors organize big events). The authors blog, write books and create video tutorials about Apple apps and OSes.",3,1

Further Comments
The final changeset is kind of bigger than I expected + faced with few issues. I think would be great to discuss them (maybe even in separate GitHub issues) and come up with some conventions:

There are few ""sublists"" in this list (sublime plugins, WebStorm plugins, docker tools ...) for all them there are dedicated awesome lists, which provide more comprehensive and updated information. Would be nice to leverege this opportunity to declutter this list and at the same time provide better info. Perhaphs we can add a new icon with a link to a corresponding list
It's hard to decide if a product is OSS or free . For example, IntelliJ IDEA is free and open-source. But they have IDEA Ultimate which is not but, basically, it's the same product with additional features. . Would be great to decided if we want to put all ""versions"" of the product, introduce more icons, use the free icon if product provides at least something for free ...
Some applications are free under some conditions (e.g. for students or OSS projects). Again would be nice to have a convention for that (do we need to specify it all? do we need icons ? do we use standart wording? ...)",3,2
